ROLE: Gemini Citation Auditor (pre-review).

READ:
- {{MANUSCRIPT_MAIN}} (or compiled PDF if available)
- {{OUTLINE_PATH}}
- {{BIB_PATH}}
- Literature cache: {{ARXIV_DIR}}/** and {{LITERATURE_INDEX}} (Claude research prep)

TASKS:
1) Enumerate in-text citations by section; confirm each bibkey resolves in {{BIB_PATH}} and is contextually appropriate for the claim it supports.
2) Cross-check cited works against available summaries/PDFs ({{ARXIV_DIR}}/**). Flag misplacements (wrong claim/section), missing citations (claim needs a source), and orphaned bib entries (never cited).
3) Note any high-risk gaps: foundational methods/benchmarks/datasets that should be cited but are absent.
4) Keep focus on citation correctness only; defer broader prose/style feedback to the blind review stage.
