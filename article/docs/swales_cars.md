# Swales' CARS Model

John Swales' "Create A Research Space" (CARS) model guides the flow of an Introduction. Use it to ensure the opening section positions the study clearly.

## Move 1 — Establishing a Territory
- Present the broad research area and why it is important.
- Cite authoritative work to show the domain is active.
- Example: “Large-scale forest typology maps underpin climate monitoring and biodiversity planning.”

## Move 2 — Establishing a Niche
- Identify gaps, unresolved questions, or limitations in current approaches.
- Use contrastive language (“however”, “yet”, “nevertheless”) to signal the turn.
- Example: “However, existing national products lag behind recent foundation-model embeddings in temporal responsiveness.”

## Move 3 — Occupying the Niche
- Announce the purpose of the present work and the approach taken.
- Outline contributions (experiment design, datasets released, evaluation insights).
- Close with a road map paragraph that previews the rest of the paper.

## Checklist
- Every paragraph in the Introduction should belong to one of the three moves.
- Avoid overloading Move 2; select the most compelling gap and keep the rest concise.
- Revisit Move 3 after major revisions to ensure the contributions still match the manuscript body.
