# Gopen & Swan Principles

Gopen and Swan’s “Science of Scientific Writing” offers heuristics for making prose easier to parse. Apply these when polishing the manuscript.

## Reader Expectation Rule
- Place familiar information at the start of a sentence and new, emphatic information at the end.
- Use topic sentences to signal the theme of the paragraph before introducing details.

## Stress Position
- Reserve the end of a sentence for the key takeaway; avoid trailing clauses that dilute the punch line.
- When possible, align stress positions at paragraph ends with the figure or table being discussed.

## Information Flow
- Link consecutive sentences by reusing key nouns or concepts; avoid abrupt shifts in subject.
- Group related sentences into “unit of thought” paragraphs—each with beginning (context), middle (action), and end (outcome).

## Editing Checklist
- Read each paragraph aloud; break long sentences that require multiple breaths.
- Replace ambiguous pronouns with the specific noun they reference.
- Ensure that parallel structures (lists, comparisons) use consistent grammar.
