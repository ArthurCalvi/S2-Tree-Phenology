# CCC & ABT Story Structures

Effective sections follow a mini narrative arc. Two complementary patterns help maintain focus: Context–Challenge–Consequence (CCC) and And–But–Therefore (ABT).

## Context – Challenge – Consequence
- **Context**: Set the scene quickly (e.g., national forest monitoring requires harmonized pipelines).
- **Challenge**: Highlight the tension or gap (e.g., embeddings promise gains but coherence is uncertain).
- **Consequence**: Explain what the work does to resolve the tension and what the reader should expect next.

Use CCC at the start of each major section or subsection to orient the reader before diving into detail.

## And – But – Therefore
- **And**: Combine established facts (“Sentinel-2 harmonics are operational AND AlphaEarth embeddings are available”).
- **But**: Introduce the complication (“BUT their comparative calibration over France is unclear”).
- **Therefore**: Signal the action or finding that addresses the complication.

ABT works well for paragraph-level transitions and for figure captions that need to motivate the visual.

## Practical Tips
- Draft with CCC for structure, then refine sentences with ABT to keep paragraphs brisk.
- Ensure the “Therefore” statements connect to measurable outcomes (accuracy, coherence, calibration).
- Revisit section openers after revisions; if the challenge or consequence changed, rewrite the setup.
