# IMRaD Quick Reference

The IMRaD pattern (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) keeps scientific writing predictable and easy to navigate.

## Introduction
- Establish the broader problem and why it matters.
- Summarize the current state of the art and remaining gaps.
- State the study objective and the hypotheses (H1–H3) the work will test.

## Methods
- Describe data sources, preprocessing, and model training decisions.
- Highlight design choices that enable reproducibility (folds, weights, evaluation metrics).
- Keep derivations lightweight—point to referenced work for established formulas.

## Results
- Present findings in the same order as the hypotheses.
- Pair each quantitative claim with the metric, dataset split, and figure/table where it appears.
- Discuss uncertainty or variance when reporting aggregated scores.

## Discussion
- Interpret the results in light of expectations and prior work.
- Outline limitations, operational implications, and next steps.
- Close with a concise recap of what the reader should take away from the study.
