# Toulmin Argument Framework

The Toulmin model breaks an argument into components that make claims persuasive and defensible. Apply it to result interpretations and discussion paragraphs.

## Core Components
- **Claim**: The statement being argued (e.g., “Embeddings reduce calibration error relative to harmonics”).
- **Data (Evidence)**: Quantitative results supporting the claim (ECE metrics, eco-region deltas, figure references).
- **Warrant**: The reasoning that links the data to the claim (why the evidence justifies the conclusion).

## Supporting Elements
- **Backing**: Additional justification for the warrant (literature references, methodological strengths).
- **Qualifier**: Acknowledges the claim’s scope or uncertainty (“likely”, “within the evaluated folds”).
- **Rebuttal**: Notes counter-arguments or limitations (“performance drops in Mediterranean eco-region”).

## Usage Tips
- When drafting a paragraph, identify the claim first and verify the supporting data exists in tables or figures.
- Add qualifiers early to avoid over-claiming; they can often be woven into the topic sentence.
- Use rebuttals sparingly in Results but prominently in the Discussion to show awareness of limitations.
