# Research Notes

This folder hosts domain-specific references and memos that support manuscript context and method descriptions.

- `deepresearch/`: field notes, external document summaries, and configuration guides used while preparing datasets and validating results.
- Keep files concise; prefer Markdown over binaries when possible.
- When adding new notes, update `article_methods.json` or log them in `article/backbone/archive/revision_notes.md` if they influence experiments or figures.
