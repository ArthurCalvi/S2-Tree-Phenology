## REGION SUMMARIES

### A – Grand Ouest cristallin et océanique

**Climate:** Strong oceanic with cool temperatures (annual average 10.0–12.5 °C), very high humidity, and frequent strong winds (noroît from NW, suroît from SW). Precipitation abundant and regular but decreasing west to east (600 mm coast to 1,500 mm Monts d'Arrée), mostly as light drizzle ("crachin breton"). Frequent fog (80–115 days/year) and moderate frost (30–50 days/year inland, e.g. Rennes). Sunshine ranges 1,500–2,100 hours/year (highest in south Brittany, lowest in Cotentin).

**Vegetation & Forests:** Broadleaf-dominated forests: **oak** (pedunculate and sessile) and **beech** thrive in humid conditions, with **chestnut** (especially Morbihan and Finistère), **hornbeam**, **birch**, and **ash** on wet soils. Conifers include **Sitka spruce**, **Douglas-fir**, **maritime pine** (southern edge - northern distribution limit), and **Scots pine**, mostly in plantations established post-1946 with Fonds Forestier National support. A relic **silver fir** ecotype (sapin de l'Aigle) adapted to high atmospheric humidity persists in Normandy plains. Notable forests include Camors, Floranges, and Lanvaux (Morbihan) with mixed oak-beech-chestnut and conifers. Forests often treated as mixed high forest/coppice, with old coppice common.

**Geology & Terrain:** Ancient Armorican crystalline massif (Hercynian orogeny) with complex geology including Precambrian/Cambrian rocks, primary era sandstones and quartzites, granites, schists, and some Miocene limestone (faluns). Low rolling hills - Monts d'Arrée peak at Roc'h Ruz (385 m), Mont des Avaloirs (417 m) highest in western France, Mont Pinçon (365 m) in Suisse normande. Rocky, indented coastline in north and west, gentle sandy beaches in south (Morbihan). Numerous deep river valleys (Orne, Vire, Loire tributaries).

**Landscape:** Extensive hedgerow landscapes (bocage) define the region, though declining for 40+ years due to agricultural intensification. Despite favorable forest potential, forest cover is sparse (~11% average, varying 7% in Bocage vendéen to 16% in Bretagne méridionale) due to dominant agriculture (>75% of land). Comprises **6 sylvoécorégions** (SER) and represents **~4%** of France's forest area.

### B – Centre Nord semi-océanique

**Climate:** Temperate semi-oceanic, intermediate between Atlantic and continental. Average temperature ~10 °C with moderate seasonality. Frequent fog and evenly distributed precipitation 500–1,000 mm/year (wetter toward east). Rainfall frequency 120–170 days/year. Frost 30–80 days/year with possible late spring frosts. Sunshine 1,600–1,850 hours/year. Winds predominantly from west, though weaker than Brittany/Aquitaine coast.

**Vegetation & Forests:** Predominantly **oak** forests: pedunculate and sessile oak mixed with **hornbeam**, **ash**, and **beech**. Oak-hornbeam-beech mixed forests widespread on mesotrophic soils. Beech dominates plateaus with lime-rich soils covered in loess, while oak-hornbeam prevails on lower slopes. On poor sandy or chalky soils, **Scots pine** stands are common (e.g. Sologne, Fontainebleau). **Maritime pine**, **Scots pine**, and **Corsican pine** widely planted to afforest marginal lands.

Important riparian **alder-ash** forests and cultivated **poplar** plantations in valley bottoms. Historic royal/ecclesiastical forests with valuable timber - Forest of Tronçais (>10,000 ha) famous for oak quality, Forest of Orléans (>34,000 ha) largest in France.

**Geology & Terrain:** Paris Basin sedimentary cuvette with concentric limestone cuestas (alternating with clay/marl depressions) from Tertiary to Jurassic age. Low plains and plateaus 0–300 m elevation with gentle slopes. Buttes (Montmorency, Mont Valérien) dot plateaus. Orléanais and Sologne formed by detrital deposits from Massif Central. Clay-with-flints (argiles à silex) cap many chalk plateaus. Extensive alluvial deposits in major river valleys. Few natural barriers except cuesta escarpments.

**Landscape:** Dominant agricultural region (71% of land) with intensive cereal cultivation in Beauce, Champagne crayeuse, Champagne berrichonne, Brie, Picardie. Pasture and livestock farming in more clay-rich Normandy. Orchards (apples, fruits) in Normandy and Pays d'Othe. Vineyards on well-exposed calcareous slopes (Champagne, Sancerre, Loire Valley). Forest cover low (~19% average, varying 5% in Plaine picarde/Beauce to 51% in Sologne) despite covering much of north-central France. Comprises **21 sylvoécorégions** (SER) and accounts for **~18%** of national forest area.

### C – Grand Est semi-continental

**Climate:** Semi-continental with colder winters and warmer summers than oceanic regions. Temperature 8–11 °C annual average, with significant amplitude (can reach 18 °C in Alsace). Precipitation 600–1,000 mm with significant local variation - very dry in Colmar (<600 mm) protected by Vosges, wetter on western slopes and north. Precipitation 120–170 days/year, relatively well distributed but summer becoming wettest season eastward. Frost 70–100 days/year with late spring frosts possible. Sunshine 1,600–1,850 hours/year. Winds predominantly from west.

**Vegetation & Forests:** Predominantly **broadleaf** forests: **sessile and pedunculate oak** forests (often with hornbeam and **beech**) widespread on mesotrophic plateaus. Oak-hornbeam-beech mixed high forest/coppice most common. Beech tends to dominate cooler uplands and lime-rich plateau tops; oak-hornbeam prevails on lower slopes. **Ash**, **lime** (Tilia), **field maple** (Acer campestre), and **wild cherry** scattered throughout. **Scots pine** and other conifers (**spruce**, **Douglas-fir**) planted on sandy or shallow-calcareous sites, but overall region remains broadleaf-rich. **Chestnut** in more acidic zones. Riparian forests with **alder**, **ash**, **willow**, and cultivated **poplar** in major valleys (Seine, Marne, Moselle, Saône, Rhône). In Rhône valley and alpine foothills, thermophilous communities with **downy oak** and **hornbeam** appear. Tempête Lothar (1999) caused heavy damage, particularly to conifer plantations.

**Geology & Terrain:** Large sedimentary plateaus with cuesta reliefs - from west to east: Côte des Bars (Portlandien), Côte de Meuse (Oxfordien), Côte de Moselle (Bajocien), Côte du Lias. Plateaus made of diverse Jurassic and Cretaceous limestones (variable hardness and lithology). Lorraine Plateau has older, predominantly clay-marl substrates (Lias, Trias). Woëvre is a humid clay plain. Plains: Alsace (graben between Vosges and Black Forest with Tertiary/Quaternary sediments), Bresse and Dombes (subsidence zones), Saône-Rhône corridor. Ardenne primaire (Paleozoic schists) and Argonne (Cretaceous gaize sandstone) at northern edge. Relief mostly 100–300 m with gentle slopes; butte-witnesses dot some areas. Pays-Fort and Puisaye approach 400 m near Morvan contact. Graben valleys with Tertiary molasses in alpine piedmont.

**Landscape:** Alternation of large-scale agriculture and vast forest massifs. Forests often cover plateau tops and hills while crops, orchards, vineyards occupy slopes and valleys. Agriculture 60% of territory: intensive cultivation on plateaus (Champagne crayeuse, Boischaut), more varied in hills (viticulture, orchards). Forest cover **31% average** (varying 23% Plaine d'Alsace and Plaines/piémonts alpins to 69% Ardenne primaire). Public (state and communal) forests important, with many large blocks. Comprises **8 sylvoécorégions** (SER), representing **~13%** of France's forest area.

### D – Vosges

**Climate:** Continental montane with strong east-west contrast. Western (Lorraine) slopes and summits receive heavy precipitation (900–2,000 mm/year proportional to altitude), while eastern (Alsace) valleys in rain shadow are drier (Colmar <600 mm/year). Colline zone receives 600–900 mm/year. Temperature 6–10 °C annual average (decreases with altitude). Large thermal amplitude (14 °C at Hohneck summit, 18 °C Alsace slope). Winters long and harsh; summers can be hot and stormy. Frost varies 75 days in plains to 159 days on ridges; late frosts dangerous for fir and oak. Snow frequent: >25 days plains, 140 days ridges, 70 days at 700 m altitude. Snowpack limits vegetative season to 3 months at highest elevations. Winds from west, strong and continuous on summits (Lothar storm 1999 exceeded 160 km/h, causing massive damage especially on western/northern slopes). Southern influences penetrate via Rhine graben.

**Vegetation & Forests:** **Montane zone** (starts ~500 m north slopes): characteristic **beech-fir** mixed forests with **silver fir**, **beech**, and extensively planted **Norway spruce** dominate to ~1,000 m. Above this, low-productivity summit **beech** forests (often managed as coppice-with-standards). **Scots pine** dominant in sandy Vosges gréseuses (sandstone Vosges) and on south slopes (Saint-Dié race). Native **Norway spruce** (Vosges race) in glacial cirques, coarse scree, and bog margins. **Colline zone**: mixed **oak-beech-hornbeam** (or beech-oak) forests most common. Oak sessile, Scots pine, and birch on nutrient-poor soils. Ash, cherry, limes in richer sites. Hornbeam absent from most acidic soils. **Valleys**: **alder**, alder-ash, and ash-maple forests. Famous forests: Val de Senones (>4,000 ha state forest, heavily damaged 1999). Very high forest cover (**~75% of montane massif**, varying to **44% in peripheral hills**). Conifers represent 40% of forest, broadleaves 24%, mixed forests 19%.

**Geology & Terrain:** Complex geological history: Hercynian orogeny (-300 Ma), then Alpine orogeny uplift (-50 Ma) causing fracture and Rhine graben formation. **Northern Vosges** (Vosges gréseuses): Triassic sandstones (Buntsandstein) - various facies from Annweiler sandstone to pink Voltzia sandstone. **Southern Vosges** (Vosges cristallines/hercyniennes): Paleozoic rocks subdivided: (1) north - Silurian/Devonian/Carboniferous sedimentary and volcanic rocks (Schirmeck, Champ du Feu); (2) central - metamorphic rocks (gneiss, migmatites) alternating with granites/syenites (limit: Villé schists, Climont); (3) south - Carboniferous/Devonian plutonic and metamorphic (granites, graywackes, gneiss, migmatites). Mountain range 70 km wide x 120 km long, strongly asymmetric: gentle western slope, abrupt eastern escarpment above Alsace plain. Rounded summits (ballons) from glacial erosion. Highest: Grand Ballon (Ballon de Guebwiller) 1,424 m. Many glacial features: cirques, moraines, glacial lakes (Lac Blanc, Lac Noir, Gérardmer). Dense river network cutting deep valleys. Peripheral hills: Vôge plateau (west), collines sous-vosgiennes (grès coquillier du Muschelkalk), Warndt (sandstone dome at German border). 60% of forest on slopes >20%.

**Landscape:** One of densest forested landscapes in France. Montane massif very heavily forested (75%), creating closed forest landscape in valleys. Agriculture 29% - diversified mountain agriculture (traditional pasture) in mountains, polyculture-élevage in hills. Viticulture and orchards (plums, cherries) on sunny peripheral hills east and south. High touristic value: castles, viewpoints, lakes. Comprises **2 sylvoécorégions** (SER): D11 Massif vosgien central (75% forest), D12 Collines périvosgiennes et Warndt (44% forest). Overall represents **~4%** of France's forest area despite small size, due to exceptional forest density.

### E – Jura

**Climate:** Continental with mountain influence, very rainy with numerous variations by altitude and exposure. Temperature 7.9–10.3 °C annual average (up to 11.5 °C in south); on Second Plateau 5.6–7.8 °C, with Mouthe holding French cold record (-36.7 °C, January 1968). Precipitation 1,000–1,800 mm, reaching/exceeding 2,000 mm in places, with significant snowfall often early. Rainfall relatively well distributed year-round, including May-August (~100 mm/month from storms). Regular precipitation compensates for limited soil water reserves on karst limestone bedrock. Southern Bugey summits (modest altitude) also approach 2,000 mm due to SW orientation perpendicular to rainy winds. Frequent frost (60–130 days/year) and autumn fog. Short vegetation season (May-August), spring practically non-existent. Winds sometimes tornado-like (orval) causing major windthrow. SW winds bring humidity; bise is cold dry NE wind.

**Vegetation & Forests:** **Collinéen stage** (<600-700 m): mixed **pedunculate oak** forests (often with **chestnut** west/southwest). **Montagnard stage** (>600 m): **beech** appears, first mixed with oaks then with **fir** and **spruce** or **douglas** (all entirely artificial in the Jura massif). Forest limit ~1,200-1,300 m; above are subalpine meadows and heaths. On Jurassic calcareous plateaus: mixed high forest-coppice of **pedunculate and sessile oak** with **hornbeam** undergrowth, very frequent especially on south slopes. **Beech**, **ash**, **limes** also present but generally mixed with oaks/hornbeam, silviculture having favored them over beech. **Hazel**, **maples**, **wild cherry** often accompany on fertile soils. Numerous conifer plantings (past 50 years) form patches of **Norway spruce** in broadleaf stands. In the Jura, fir plantings under shelter have evolved variably toward fir or beech-fir stands. In Jurassic mountains, **beech**, **beech-fir**, and **fir** stands (often mixed with spruce) constitute forest majority, often managed as selection forest (futaie jardinée) mainly in Jura on drier soils than Doubs where regular high forest more common. Remarkable fir stands called "sapins présidents" in Jura. Spruce also covers large area from artificial reforestations recent decades. **Oak-beech** forests with hornbeam undergrowth also present at lowest elevations, while lime or maple stands scattered on scree. More or less pure beech occupies lower subalpine stage, progressively giving way to spruce-beech mosaic in middle subalpine. Riparian forests are alder or willow with ash and pedunculate oak. In south, less humid climate and shallower soils induced penetration of submediterranean species: **pubescent oak**, **boxwood**, **maple** (obier-leaved and Montpellier, especially southern Bugey). Domain of thermophilous and mesophilous oak forests, with much hazel undergrowth. Bogs and marshes (relatively frequent) colonized by birch and spruce with acidophilous flora.

**Geology & Terrain:** The Jura is an Alpine orogeny countershock, resulting from secondary calcareous terrain sliding on an elevated crystalline base, causing folds or fractures: cluses, combes, and reculées are characteristic Jurassic relief features. Constituted of compact limestones (often dolomitic) from Jurassic superior (Callovien, Oxfordien, Argovien, Rauracien, Kimméridgien, Portlandien) and Cretaceous marly layers. Limestone beds often vertical, forming plateau edges and high chain crests; very fissured corallian limestones (laizines), consequently permeable. Jurassic plateau centers covered by glacial deposits (clayey, impermeable) giving deep brown soils and numerous small lakes (Étival, Bonlieu, La Motte/Ilay, Narlay). Locally, Triassic marl outcrops englobing (as breccias) Liassic sandstones and gryphaea limestones. Syncline bottoms composed of Oxfordian marls giving good brown soils. However, on certain locally tabular zones, deeper soils on decalcification clay. Valleys occupied by either deep marly soils or clayey glacial deposits. Substratum locally covered by Quaternary superficial formations (loess, flint loess). Between central Bugey wooded ridges, two N-S synclines (Condamine-Izenave-Aranc and Brenod-Hauteville-Cormaranche) have bases occupied by glacial alluvium deposited after alpine glacier retreat, for pastoral use. Limestone covered by alternating marly-calcareous strata or gave rise to molasses (sandstones with clayey limestone cement). General GRECO E form: NE/SW oriented crescent extending from southern Germany to northern Ain via Switzerland. Alternation of plateaus and calcareous anticlinal chains with heavy, sometimes tabular relief, altitudes 500 m (valley bottoms) to 1,700 m with French summits: crêt du Nu (1,351 m) south, crêt de Chalam (1,545 m), crêt de la Neige (1,718 m - Jura highest point), crêt Pela (1,495 m) ascending NE. Steep slopes between crest lines, especially northward.

**Landscape:** Production forests situated 600-1,300 m altitude, presenting significant slopes (50% surveys on slopes >20%). Moving from proper Jurassic mountain, three zones distinguished: **North**: main GRECO part is karst plateau oriented SW-NE, subdivided longitudinally (same orientation) into three successive steps of 500, 600, 700 m altitudes. Northern first plateau: tabular relief modified by anticlinal fold - Lormont (800 m) oriented frankly E-W, crossed in cluse by Doubs valley. **Center**: succession of ~10 N-S oriented calcareous ridges peaking 500-800 m, separating longitudinal valleys 300-400 m altitude. Between certain ridges are enclosed synclines with flowing rivers (N to S): Ain, Suran, Oignin, Bienne. Most western ridges have altitude attenuating northward (350 m). Dams built on Ain creating important water reservoirs (Vouglans, Saut Mortier, Coiselet). **South**: Bugey composed of plateau 650-1,100 m altitude, studded with anticlinal chains more or less tilted westward, with rounded forms. To east attached "chaînons calcaires entre Jura et Savoie" separated from GRECO E by: Geneva plain (Salève, Mandallaz); Bourget lake (montagne du Gros Foug, mont de Corsuet); Rhône (mont du Chat, montagne de l'Épine). Extreme south: GRECO ends with NW/SE oriented folds 300-800 m altitude, reaching 1,217 m at Molard Dedon. Île Crémieu is calcareous plateau belonging to southern Jurassic ridges extremity dominating Bas-Dauphiné plain beside southern Bugey where relief sinks to inclined plateau toward Rhône valley. Forest cover relatively high, exceeding 50% in both sylvoécorégions. Agriculture also well represented (~41%), especially cattle/sheep livestock in extensive mountain pasture. Abandoned pastoral formations naturally evolve toward loose woodlands with uncertain forest stand limits. Jurassic vineyard extends on Revermont and Petite Montagne between Bresse and First Jura Plateau (Arbois…), with nearby woods planted in black locust for stake supply. Comprises **2 sylvoécorégions** (SER). Represents **~3%** of France's forest area.

### F – Sud-Ouest océanique

**Climate:** Oceanic type, subject to west wind influence but degrading eastward with summer drought appearance. Rains distributed all seasons, rarely violent, but more important autumn/winter. Annual precipitation 660 mm (Toulouse-Blagnac) to 1,050 mm (northern Périgord). Annual average temperature 10 °C (Causses) to 12.9 °C (Bordeaux-Mérignac). Climate characterized by frequent fog and very significant thermal amplitude, especially in Landes massif. Violent west winds often sweep GRECO but rarely reach speeds near 200 km/h like Martin storm (27 December 1999) then Klaus 9 years 1 month later (24 January 2009), causing major forest damage, particularly in Landes de Gascogne maritime pine stands. Forest damage distribution very uneven region to region but downed wood volume considerable, mainly in Aquitaine with 27.7M m³ (Agriculture/Fisheries Ministry, February 2000) after Martin and 40M m³ after Klaus.

**Vegetation & Forests:** **North**: Quercy causses are calcareous plateaus with characteristic karst relief: dry valleys, small clayey depressions, sinkholes, and narrow valleys (Dordogne, Lot, Aveyron). Soils very shallow covered by **pubescent or holm oak** and **juniper** woods. Périgord plateaus more undulating, covered by **oak** and **chestnut** forests. Wider valleys offer fertile plains framed by cliffs inhabited since Paleolithic. Charente calcareous plains (~100 m altitude) fertile, cultivated, little wooded. Forest occupies zones abandoned by agriculture on slopes: often low stands, weak production. Exposure induces species: **pedunculate oak** on north slopes, **pubescent oak** on south. **Chestnut** found on non-calcareous soils. Approaching Landes forest massif, **maritime pine** introduced to increase production. **Center/South**: soft terrains composed of molasse dissected into small hills: Agenais, Armagnac, Gascogne slopes, or Lauragais landscapes. Very numerous river valleys crisscross region forming as many plains like Toulouse region. In these valleys, besides riparian woodlands, numerous **poplar** plantations. **West**: Landes de Gascogne form 200 km N-S, >120 km W-E triangle. Protected from sea by vast dune belt hampering water evacuation to ocean, this marshy plain was drained mid-19th century, now covered by immense **maritime pine** forest. At south, drier climate and shallower soils induced submediterranean species penetration: **pubescent oak**, **boxwood**, **obier-leaved maple**, **Montpellier maple** (particularly southern Bugey). Domain of thermophilous and mesophilous oak forests, with much hazel undergrowth. Bogs and marshy zones (relatively frequent) colonized by **birch** and **spruce** accompanied by acidophilous flora.

**Geology & Terrain:** Aquitaine Basin is sedimentary basin filled at secondary era with sediments mainly composed of calcareous rocks. But Tertiary Pyrénées and (by countershock) Massif Central uplift raised layers east/north of GRECO, where they outcrop in Quercy causses, Périgord, or Charente with westward slope. South: layers folded, buried under debris torn from Pyrénées by rivers; general slope south-north: Lannemezan dejection cone. Molassic terrains from Pyrénées/Massif Central erosion mixed with calcareous or detrital intercalated formations with sandy, sandy-limestone, or calcareous levels from which derive "terreforts" on clayey zones and "boulbènes" on loess. Vast Landes plain geological substratum constituted mostly of loose siliceous formations, essentially aeolian origin, covering (sometimes thick) varied Tertiary sedimentary formations at Quaternary. Garonne basin occupied by series of ancient alluvial terraces (boulbènes) and recent alluvium. GRECO F: Sud-Ouest océanique corresponds to Aquitaine Basin geographical entity. Plains and hills extend from northern Poitevin marsh to Pyrénées foot south, and west from Atlantic Ocean to Massif Central border and Lauragais. Linked to Paris Basin by Poitou threshold. Another GRECO characteristic: mild oceanic climate, more/less marked at different sylvoécorégions, with Atlantic winds. Funnel-shaped, widely open to Atlantic (330 km long coast), delimited south by Pyrénées, NE by Massif Central, north by Sèvre niortaise. Vast plains/plateaus ensemble cut by dense hydrographic network, altitude between sea level and 650 m south at Pyrénées border.

**Landscape:** Forest cover 30% overall GRECO F, however very variable: most wooded SER Landes de Gascogne (75%), least wooded Marais littoraux (2%) and Groies (10%). Note: Linear elements (mainly hedges) not included in forest cover. **North**: causses du Quercy are calcareous plateaus with characteristic karst relief: dry valleys, small clayey depressions, sinkholes, narrow valleys (Dordogne, Lot, Aveyron). Soils very shallow covered by pubescent/holm oak and juniper woods. Périgord plateaus more undulating, covered by oak-chestnut forests. Wider valleys offer fertile plains framed by cliffs inhabited since Paleolithic. Charente calcareous plains (~100 m altitude) fertile, cultivated, little wooded. Forest occupies zones agriculture abandons on slopes: often low stands, weak production. Exposure induces species: pedunculate oak on north slope, pubescent oak on south. Chestnut found on non-calcareous soils. Approaching Landes forest massif, maritime pine introduced to increase production. **Center/South**: soft terrains composed of molasse dissected into small hills: Agenais, Armagnac, Gascogne slopes, or Lauragais landscapes. Very numerous river valleys crisscross region forming as many plains like Toulouse region. In valleys besides riparian woodlands, numerous poplar plantations. **West**: Landes de Gascogne form 200 km N-S, >120 km W-E triangle. Protected from sea by vast dune belt hampering water evacuation to ocean, this marshy plain drained mid-19th century, now covered by immense maritime pine forest. Comprises **12 sylvoécorégions** (SER). Network includes essentially Adour, Garonne, Dordogne, and Charente basins, presenting general E-W orientation for Garonne tributaries from Massif Central and coastal rivers (Adour, Charente, Sèvre niortaise) or S-N for Pyrénées tributaries.

### G – Massif central

**Climate:** Montagnard at altitudes >~600 m, varying strongly with oceanic/Mediterranean influences. **West façade** (Ségala, Châtaigneraies auvergnate/Centre/Ouest, granitic/Limousin plateaus, volcanic zone, Morvan) under oceanic influence from humid west winds: abundant precipitation (800-1,500 mm, even 2,000 mm altitude) regularly distributed. Important frost days (~100 days/year >600 m Morvan), frequent late frosts until May. Cool but stormy summers, late spring; snow from November, often on summits until July but irregular year-to-year at mid-mountain. Annual average temperature 8-11.5 °C inhabited zones. **SE façade** (Cévennes, Grands Causses, mainly southern Massif Central border) subject to Mediterranean influences characterized by perturbation intensity (1,000-1,600 mm, even 2,000 mm mont Aigoual); distributed over few days especially autumn/spring (cévenol episodes), separated by long drought periods. Annual average temperature very often >10 °C, but 5 °C at Aigoual with >100 frost days/year. Frequent altitude fog but important sunshine; cold sensation from north/SE winds; very irregular snow. Vegetation typically Mediterranean on south slopes. **Alluvial plains/Massif Central piedmonts**, sheltered by surrounding relief, have drier climate. Cold dry winters, hot (canicular) summers possible; annual average temperature 10.5-11.3 °C, precipitation 550-700 mm; rarer snow from winter precipitation deficit. Besides altitude, N-S mountain orientation accentuates precipitation level differences. W-E versant opposition dominates over adret-ubac nuances.

**Vegetation & Forests:** GRECO G belongs to Atlantic biogeographic domain (Massif Central sector within), with variable characteristics by altitude, latitude, longitude, constituting vast transition zone with continental domain, where Atlantic tonality still strongly expressed in Morvan, Forez, mont Pilat, Cévennes. Local climate diversity implies varied vegetation/landscapes. **West slopes** (N to S): **collinéen stage** (altitude <600-700 m) occupied mainly by mixed predominantly **pedunculate oak** forest, often mixed with **chestnut** west/southwest. Above 600 m in **montagnard stage**, **beech** appears, first mixed with oaks then with **fir** and **spruce** or **douglas** (all entirely artificial origin throughout Massif Central). Forest limit ~1,200-1,300 m, witnessing climate harshness. Higher: subalpine grasslands and heaths. **East slopes**: fir and beech limited to high atmospheric humidity zones; replaced by **Scots pine** notably in Margeride, Velay, Causses. **Pubescent oak**, **holm oak** and Mediterranean species cortege occupy drier slopes subject to summer drought. These zones interspersed with vast little-wooded heaths used for grazing (Aubrac), colonized by Scots pine in spontaneous woodlands. Finally, chestnut found in Cévennes at warmer climate, altitude <700 m; exposure importance increasingly felt, versant asymmetry very marked. Although situated at western extremity of European Union continental biogeographic region for Natura 2000 implementation, Massif Central falls under Atlantic biogeographic domain for France, as shown by: total absence of beech forest continental to whitish wood-rush; presence of typically Atlantic habitats like holly beech forest to Haute-Loire; presence of Atlantic heaths with ash-grey heather to mont Pilat.

**Geology & Terrain:** Massif Central, essentially crystalline (granite/gneiss), results from Hercynian folding which metamorphosed primary deposits, except extreme south (Montagne noire) and coal deposits (Decazeville, Autun, Saint-Étienne for example). Then eroded until forming peneplain, covered by Jurassic deposits themselves removed by erosion except at edges and in Causses "gulf". Finally uplifted during Pyrénées then Alps Tertiary formation. Massif Central thus fragmented by major faults, at which magma rises induced Puys chain formation and other isolated more complex volcanoes, plus basaltic plateaus (planèzes) from lava flows. Massif thus has asymmetric profile based on south/east pushes, Limousin Plateau gently inclined westward. Initial base remained intact south at Causses level by faults which countered exerted pushes. However interspersed by very deep gorges like Tarn. Two major collapse troughs, Limagne (Allier valley) and Forez plain (Loire valley) also result from Alpine orogeny. Volcanism active in Tertiary: Cantal, Aubrac, Velay and Quaternary: monts Dôme. GRECO G relief formed west by vast inclined mid-altitude plateaus (300-1,500 m) extending south by Ségala and Châtaigneraie auvergnate. Central N-S oriented volcanic zone includes isolated volcanoes like Puys chain or complex like Plomb du Cantal (1,855 m) and puy de Sancy (1,886 m, Massif Central highest point), ending south with Aubrac and Cézallier plateaus. East of Ségala and Limousin Châtaigneraie: Grands Causses with characteristic karst relief, limited east by Cévennes with tormented "serres" form relief. Finally south: plateau rises, ending with Haut-Languedoc mountains (1,699 m mont Lozère, 1,567 m mont Aigoual) and Montagne noire (1,211 m pic de Nore) in Cévennes extension. Hercynian mid-mountain massif, summit 1,886 m Puy de Sancy, with rounded relief. Limited by: Aquitaine Basin west, Paris Basin north, Rhône valley east, Languedoc plains south/SE.

**Landscape:** Mix of mountains, plateaus, hills, plains, valleys, occupying ~one-sixth France (85,000 km²), entirely situated in Atlantic biogeographic domain, bordering continental influences east and Mediterranean south. Forest cover ~35% with very significant variations by SER. By their climatic/geological resemblance with Limousin Châtaigneraie, Gâtine heights (Deux-Sèvres) attached, so GRECO groups 14 sylvoécorégions (SER). **West GRECO G plateaus** cut N to S by: Cher, Creuse, Vienne, Corrèze, Dordogne, Lot, Aveyron, Tarn valleys for main rivers, plus their tributaries like Vézère, Truyère, Viaur, Agout. These watercourses characterized by low waters summer, cold season floods linked to Atlantic influences; therefore numerous dams punctuate them to regulate flow, permit surrounding plains irrigation plus electricity production. Outside these artificial reservoirs, numerous but small lakes partially compensate this zone underground reserve absence (except Causses level). **NE**: Massif Central cut by Limagnes collapse basins surrounding Forez mountains, ending with Beaujolais and Lyonnais mountains at Saône/Rhône valleys limit. In Limagnes flow Loire, Allier and tributaries like Sioule. Massif Central is France water tower: rivers feed Loire-Bretagne basins north, Adour-Garonne west/SW, Rhône-Méditerranée east/SE, where Vivarais and Cévennes constitute watershed. Rivers like Eyrieux, Ardèche, Gardons, Hérault, Orb for main are quite short, flowing in strong slope versant valleys, irregular flow subject to Mediterranean influences. Devastating autumn floods from cévenol episodes; phenomenon accentuated by 19th century forest overexploitation, important early 20th century reforestation campaign conducted to retain versant terrain, avoid mudflows in plains. Thermalism developed in ~20 sites, cosmetics industry uses waters/muds extracted from these regions where volcanism confers therapeutic properties. One-third mineral springs found in Massif Central, producing half France's consumed bottled waters. Comprises **14 sylvoécorégions** (SER).

### H – Alpes

**Climate:** Montagnard, continental tendency north (cold winters), Mediterranean tendency south/SW (strong thermal amplitudes, autumn rains). Mediterranean influences ascend Durance, Bléone, Verdon valleys. Versant effect increasingly marked southward, strongly felt in vegetation from strong insolation and water lack especially summer. Production forests mainly confined to cooler "envers" (ubacs), near villages to drier "endroits" (adrets). Average annual precipitation 750 mm Haute-Maurienne to 3,500 mm Chartreuse summits at comparable altitudes (~2,000 m). Humid west winds stopped by western Alps façade hence important precipitation accumulation independent of altitude. Moreover, W-E climatic zonation of entire Alpine chain exists based on humid west wind exposure and foehn effect. Thus classically distinguished: **Préalpes/Alpes externes** (Vercors, Belledonne, Beaufortain) where oceanic influence gives important well year-distributed precipitation (no dry season), especially W-oriented slopes; **Alpes intermédiaires** (Trièves, Grandes Rousses) mainly subject to foehn effect, more marked dry season especially E-exposed slopes at low/mid-altitude; **Alpes internes** (Oisans/Vanoise east slope) watered mainly on W-exposed high-altitude slopes due to strong continentality, making them drier than intermédiaires; **Mediterranean-influenced Alpes** (externes/intermédiaires Sud) with weak precipitation (<800 mm/year) mainly autumn/winter. Overall GRECO: average annual temperatures lower east in Alpes internes N/S (5.3 °C Lanslebourg-Mont-Cenis), progressively increasing southward (13.9 °C Nyons) and westward (11.6 °C Vercors). However, altitude elevation always causes temperature drop and corresponding precipitation increase which can depending on case compensate or accentuate this gradient. **Northern Alps** marked by significant snow reaching 8-9 m altitude, lasting long (100 days/year) with frost periods >150 days/year Chamonix. Going east: long but moderately cold winters, short (3-4 months) cool summers; spring/autumn practically non-existent. Main wind: bise, rushing into glacial valleys, cooling ambient air. **Southern Alps** characterized by irregular rain distribution (mainly autumn), marked summer drought with storms, strong thermal amplitude from cloud absence causing strong nighttime heat loss while sun raises daytime temperature. Mistral sometimes very violent lowers winter temperatures, gives cold sensation (-1 °C per 10 km/h tranche), contributes to land desiccation inducing rather arid climatic ambiance unfavorable to productive forests. Other wind blowing lesser degree on Southern Alps: marine wind bringing humidity and mildness.

**Vegetation & Forests:** GRECO H corresponds to alpine sector of high mountains biogeographic domain defined by Habitats directive. All vegetation stages represented in this GRECO, from mesoméditerranéen to nival, but sensible difference exists between Northern/Southern Alps, Ventoux appearing as singularity given its southern situation. **NORTHERN ALPS - Collinéen stage** (average annual temperature 8-12 °C, vegetation period >200 days), reduced to low valley bottoms and piedmonts: **chestnut** and **sessile oak** (often with **beech**) are main broadleaf species. **Ash** and **large maples** limited to fresh humid environments along watercourses or on flats/lower slopes. **Montagnard stage** (average annual temperature 4-8 °C, vegetation period remaining >200 days): beech maintains only on W-exposed slopes (Préalpes/externes Alpes), **fir** and **spruce** naturally regenerate except upstream Chamonix valley (too cold for fir): predilection domain for fir forest and fir-spruce forest, even pure montagnard spruce forests. **Scots pine** invades adrets and ubac lows of Alpes internes. At altitude limit with subalpin appear **larch** stands corresponding to former stands having recolonized abandoned agricultural spaces. **Subalpin stage** (average annual temperature -2 to +4 °C, vegetation period fluctuating 100-200 days) sees **Swiss stone pine** appearance on north exposure and **mountain pine** on south/west exposure. Forest vegetation altitude limit ~2,200 m with stunted sparse stands, then **alpine stage** rocky heaths and meadows (average annual temperature <0 °C, vegetation period <100 days) cover soil to nival stage where flowering plants disappear. Pine stands occupy difficult situations, particularly dry: adrets, shallow/chemically poor soils, ridges/upper slopes. In this northern Alps part, Alpes internes also distinguished from intermédiaires by beech absence. **SOUTHERN ALPS**: Mediterranean influences already sensible particularly externes/intermédiaires Alpes. Low mountains of **collinéen stage** (in fact joins supraméditerranéen of Mediterranean climate zone) covered by **pubescent oak**, **sessile oak** or **chestnut** forests, sometimes mixed **beech** or **lime**. Forestry-wise this Alps part appears poorer than north given almost total broadleaf absence except valley bottoms and around villages. Many erosion scars appear beside forest stands. At **montagnard stage**, **pineraies** and **larchwoods** with straight slender trees giving magnificent high forests participate in formerly grazed zone recolonization. Conversely **fir forests** have important productivity unless hot dry climate or unfavorable soil (shallow, carbonated, with rocky outcrops): dry calcicole beech or beech-fir forests rich in orchids. At **subalpin stage**, fir replaces spruce with same vegetation as Northern Alps. But sylvopastoral aspect is landscape striking trait, where pastures and alpine pastures succeed clear high forests or larch herbaceous meadow-woods browsed by herds. Forests found on heights, low zones reserved for agriculture giving bocage landscape with some small woodlands or riparian forests. On north exposure: beautiful fir-beech high forests found but most often coppice or beech low high forests mixed Scots pine. Low altitude adrets covered by loose **pubescent oak** and **Scots pine** woodlands fragmented by heaths with Mediterranean vegetation (boxwood, Montpellier maple, amelanchier, ashy broom). These stand trees striking for their low height and tortuous form. Beech locally present on fresh montane ubacs. On ravined marls: old RTM **Austrian black pine** plantings. Reforestations in Austrian black pine and **cedar** plus **maritime pine** plantations diversify forest landscapes. **Ventoux particular case**: All vegetation stages succeed from mesoméditerranéen to subalpin, but forest presence on mont Ventoux intimately linked to man. Wooded surface experienced over time and human activities several extension/regression phases, current forest massif largely artificial. Indeed reforestations largely modified original vegetation by Atlas cedar introduction on south slope (GRECO J: Méditerranée) in pubescent oak stage and north slope in Scots pine stage, **Austrian black pine** showing very great regeneration faculties, favored natural species return like beech and fir. Thus approaching summit, beech forest and boxwood fir forest (with spruce and larch) now cover significant surfaces.

**Landscape:** Situated in SE quarter France, GRECO H: Alpes corresponds to western occidental Alpine arc part, present in Slovenia, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and France where it groups great majority montane zones east of Rhône (outside Jurassic calcareous ridges attached to GRECO C: Grand Est semi-continental and Southern Préalpes). Extending over Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur administrative regions, includes Northern Préalpes plus external, intermediate, internal Alpes; Southern Préalpes attached to GRECO J: Méditerranée for climatic reasons. Very dense hydrographic network whether rivers or torrents form. Except some coastal rivers (Mediterranean), most join Rhône; can cite N to S: **Rhône tributaries/sub-tributaries**: Dranse, Giffre (Chablais), Arve, Fier (Aravis), Chéran (Bauges), Guiers mort/vif (Chartreuse), Drôme, Aigue (Eygues), Ouvèze; **Isère + tributaries**: Arly (Aravis), Bourne, Vernaison (Vercors), Romanche, Dorons, Arc, Drac; **Durance + main tributaries**: Guil, Ubaye, Buëch, Verdon, Bléone. Numerous dams built on most these watercourses to regulate them and produce hydroelectric energy from thus-created artificial lakes. Important territory part (~50%) occupied by forest. "No vegetation" part grouping terrains without vegetation cover and without water (rocks, glaciers) non-negligible (17.5% GRECO territory) as forest doesn't meet necessary development conditions, certain surface even exceeds vegetation limit. In externes Sud Alpes: drought and erosion make forest installation/maintenance difficult. Agricultural spaces include crops concentrated in valley collinéen stage where vines, walnut groves, maize don't exceed oak zone. At montagnard dominate low cereal crops and especially livestock (cattle north, sheep south). Subalpin entirely devoted to livestock. Production forest massifs on steep slopes marked by relatively dense access network but exploitation conditions often remain difficult. Numerous winter sports stations occupy subalpin and upper montagnard stages, contributing to further fragment these slope stands, at least for alpine skiing, Nordic ski facilities (constructions aside) altering plateau landscapes less (e.g. Vercors). Geomorphological and climatic differences permit subdividing GRECO H into **6 sylvoécorégions** (SER).

### I – Pyrénées

**Climate:** Varies strongly along the Pyrenean barrier. **West**: oceanic with montane tendency - high humidity, abundant precipitation, mildness from west winds. **Central**: montane climate with rigorous, long winters and hot, sunny summers. Vegetation period April 15 to November 15 on average. **East**: Mediterranean influences with montane tendency - irregular precipitation regime, cold snowy but extremely bright winters (2,400 sunshine hours in Cerdagne), with solar experiments like Thémis at Targassonne. Summits receive heavy precipitation as snow. Strong violent winds from NW (tramontane in Pyrénées-Orientales), SE/SSE (autan at Toulouse), or east (marin, grec, siroco in SE). Average annual precipitation 642 mm at Angoustrine-Villeneuve-des-Escaldes (1,381 m, Cerdagne) to 1,600 mm at Irouléguy (230 m, Pyrénées-Atlantiques), can exceed 2,000 mm near summits as snow in central Pyrénées. Vallespir, exposed to maritime influences without relief protection, is wettest region of Pyrénées-Orientales. Average annual temperature 8–14 °C: 7.7 °C at Mont-Louis (1,600 m), 9.1 °C at Belcaire in Aude (1,000 m), 11.5 °C at Foix (388 m), 14.3 °C at Amélie-les-Bains (270 m). Protected valleys benefit from drier, warmer microclimate like upper Neste d'Aure valley. Frost days <50 in low zones of central Pyrénées.

**Vegetation & Forests:** **West slopes (N to S)**: **Collinéen stage** (altitude <600-700 m) occupied mainly by mixed predominantly **pedunculate oak** forest, often with **chestnut** west/southwest. Above 600 m in **montagnard stage**, **beech** appears, first mixed with oaks then with **fir**, **spruce**, or **douglas** (all entirely artificial throughout Massif Central). Forest limit ~1,200-1,300 m, witnessing climate harshness; higher are subalpine grasslands and heaths. **East slopes**: fir and beech limited to high atmospheric humidity zones; replaced by **Scots pine** notably in Margeride, Velay, Causses. **Pubescent oak**, **holm oak**, and Mediterranean species cortege occupy drier slopes subject to summer drought. These zones interspersed with vast little-wooded heaths used for grazing (Aubrac), colonized by Scots pine in spontaneous woodlands. Chestnut found in Cévennes at warmer climate, altitude <700 m; exposure importance increasingly felt, versant asymmetry very marked. **Beech-fir** mixed forests with **beech**, **fir**, and extensively planted **Norway spruce** dominate montane zone to ~1,000 m in montane Vosges (starts ~500 m north slopes). Above, low-productivity summit beech forests. Colline zone: mixed **oak-beech-hornbeam** forests most common, with oak sessile, Scots pine, and birch on nutrient-poor soils. Famous forests include Val de Senones. Very high forest cover (~75% of montane massif, varying to 44% in peripheral hills). East, where climate has Mediterranean influences, marked adret-ubac vegetation difference: south/east versants weakly wooded with heaths, grasslands, low maquis, garrigues, poor taillis of **holm oak** or **cork oak**; higher **pubescent oak** mixes with holm oak, some **chestnut** to ~1,500 m; still higher Scots pine, beech, fir stages succeeded by **mountain pine**, interspersed with alpine grasslands and rock crests, vegetation limit ~1,700 m altitude. North/west versants much more wooded with lower vegetation stage limits; striking trait is abundance of chestnut taillis descending in patches into holm oak maquis in valley bottoms; cork oak rare while pubescent oak often mixes with holm oak and chestnut; beech appears ~800-900 m, first mixed with chestnut/oak then in pure stands; birch fairly present at altitude, sometimes as scattered trees with ash among alpine grasslands and bracken-gorse heaths; as altitude rises, Scots pine forms majority of stands with occasional beech-fir forests.

**Geology & Terrain:** Pyrénées result from Hercynian orogeny at end of Primary era, due to Iberian and Eurasian plate collision, followed by important erosion of uplifted, folded, metamorphosed sedimentary layers, leaving exposed in axial chain zone materials from deep earth's crust. After calm period, Tertiary Alpine orogeny gave birth to current chain, remodeled by erosion and succession of warm climate periods and glaciations. Materials carried by rivers deposited at chain periphery. Geological substratum very varied, with important presence of magmatic and metamorphic rocks (gneiss, granites, migmatites, phyllades) in chain center and associated thrust nappes north and south, and outcrops of non-metamorphosed sedimentary rocks (marnes, sandstones, limestones) north and south (in Spain). From west to east and north to south: **Petites Pyrénées**: Jurassic, Cretaceous, or Eocene age terrains - calcareous crests dominating marneous, clayey, or sandy depressions, and further south schist-sandstone flysch, breccias, conglomerates. **Razès**: Eocene and Oligocene molasses mixed with calcareous formations, sandstones, pudding stones, sables. **Piège**: marnes, limestones, sables, gravels, pudding stones. **North Corbières occidentales**: molasses and marnes with calcareous banks (montagne de l'Alaric) and pudding stones. **South Corbières occidentales**: Primary terrains with siliceous dominance in Mouthoumet region then Secondary terrains with calcareous dominance (Galamus gorges). **North Pays de Sault**: broad band of Secondary terrains, beginning with powerful Urgonian limestone formation sometimes marbleized, carved into gorges by Aude valley, then marnes and schists band where Rébenty and Boulzane valleys carved, and finally further south metamorphosed Secondary terrains with interspersed gneiss, hornfels, and micaschist cores. **Center Pays de Sault**: Primary terrains - schists, limestones, dolomites; and south a granitic core belonging to Pyrenean axial zone, dominated by Madrès massif bearing some glacial deposits. **Têt valley**: some Pliocene deposits in Prades basin. **Canigou foot**: some morainic patches formed principally of gneiss and granites. Relief presents extraordinary variety of forms resulting from rocks' mineralogical nature and erosion resistance. Often very steep, cut by narrow gorges or canyons rising in vertical cliffs or rock bars amid forest-covered versants, or karstic, notably Arbailles region. Altitude varies 200 m (in Bordure sous-pyrénéenne) to 3,298 m Vignemale, French Pyrénées highest point. Highest zones situated in chain center, declining altitude east, north, west. Valleys often end in cirques (Gavarnie), making passage to Spain impossible except via some cols (Pourtalet) or tunnels (Somport). Haute-chaîne extends east via Pyrénées catalanes and Pays de Sault with altitude varying 800-1,600 m. Latter constituted of plateau and crest ensemble carved by deep valleys or gorges like Pierre-Lys: 2 km length, 20 m width, with cliffs >300 m above Aude. Pays de Sault dominated by some summits of which Madrès (2,469 m) at extreme south is highest. Pyrénées catalanes culminate at 2,921 m puig Carlit; crests >2,000 m altitude surround Têt valley. Further south, Tech valley rises at Spanish border, separated from Têt only by Canigou chain (2,784 m), visible from afar from Roussillon plain. At extreme SE, Albères chain with lower summits constitutes Spanish border. At periphery toward north, Petites Pyrénées and Plantaurel are transition zone between high montane relief zones and plain. This hill ensemble more/less marked is formed of large linear chains, interspersed with small valleys and deep hollows; average altitude 400 m, culminating at 1,014 m pic de l'Aspre, between Foix and Lavelanet. At GRECO NE, Corbières occidentales and west of pre-Pyrenean Corbières méridionales massif are low mountain zone, relatively confused disposition, where some crest lines dominate with general E-W orientation; altitude averaging 600 m, culminating at 1,250 m pech de Bugarach, decreasing northward.

**Landscape:** Production forests situated 600-1,300 m altitude, presenting significant slopes (50% surveys on slopes >20%). Moving from proper Jurassic mountain, three zones distinguished: **North**: main GRECO part is karst plateau oriented SW-NE, subdivided longitudinally into three successive steps of 500, 600, 700 m altitudes. Northern first plateau has tabular relief modified by anticlinal fold Lormont (800 m) oriented frankly E-W, crossed in cluse by Doubs valley. **Center**: succession of ~10 N-S oriented calcareous ridges peaking 500-800 m, separating longitudinal valleys 300-400 m altitude. Between certain ridges are enclosed synclines with flowing rivers (N to S): Ain, Suran, Oignin, Bienne. Most western ridges have altitude attenuating northward (350 m). Dams built on Ain creating important water reservoirs (Vouglans, Saut Mortier, Coiselet). **South**: Bugey composed of plateau 650-1,100 m altitude, studded with anticlinal chains more/less tilted westward, with rounded forms. Attached east are "chaînons calcaires entre Jura et Savoie" separated from GRECO E by: Geneva plain (Salève, Mandallaz); Bourget lake (montagne du Gros Foug, mont de Corsuet); Rhône (mont du Chat, montagne de l'Épine). Extreme south: GRECO ends with NW/SE oriented folds 300-800 m altitude, reaching 1,217 m at Molard Dedon. Forest cover relatively high. Comprises **5 sylvoécorégions** (SER). Represents **~5%** of France's forest area.

### J – Méditerranée

**Climate:** Mediterranean type: hot dry summers, fairly mild humid winters. Mediterranean stores heat and restores it afterward. Average annual precipitation 450 mm at sea coast in western GRECO part to 1,200 mm at contact with limiting reliefs. Falls often in <80 days, particularly spring and autumn, during "cévenol episodes": strong rains (can exceed 100 mm in few hours), mixed with violent wind plastering them against reliefs, can become torrential and devastating for soils, especially after long drought period, provoking floods in coastal plains. Snow, even if not persistent, not rare on heights. Ligure sector has very marked Mediterranean climate benefiting maximally from sea's regulating influence, offering great winter mildness on coast and more important humidity, even at sea level (800 mm at Antibes), under effect of east winds from Gulf of Genoa. Average annual temperature 10.9 °C at Plan-d'Aups-Ste-Baume (700 m altitude) to 16.6 °C at Toulon (sea level). Distance from coast translates to increased thermal amplitude decreasing annual average temperatures. Climate characterized by strong winds: NW sector (tramontane in Roussillon) or broad S sector (marin), humid; and especially N sector (mistral), violent, cold, desiccating, can exceed 100 km/h, whose beneficial side is preventing late frosts by mixing lower atmospheric layers. In this GRECO, wind blows on average 300 days/year. Cold impression, despite beautiful sun, still accentuated by mistral (-1°C per 10 km/h bracket). Annual sunshine very important: 2,500 hours at Perpignan, 2,700 h at Montpellier, 2,835 h at Marseille, 2,700 h at Nice; accentuates exposure importance (adret/ubac opposition) on vegetation.

**Vegetation & Forests:** GRECO J corresponds to continental sector of Mediterranean biogeographic region defined by Habitats directive. French Mediterranean region comprises two domains: **Catalano-Provençal domain**, with dominant subatlantic influences, characterized by holm oak forest with viburnum-tinus; **Liguro-Tyrrhenian domain**, with mild winters and more humid climate, characterized by holm oak forest with manna ash; Corse constituting GRECO K, this domain here reduced to niçois and pré-ligure sectors alone. In Catalano-Provençal domain, GRECO J corresponds, from maritime plain to summits, to thermoméditerranéen (0-100 m altitude, average temperature warmest month >3 °C), mésoméditerranéen (to 450-650 m altitude, positive average temperature coldest month), supraméditerranéen (to 800-1,000 m, average temperature coldest month between 0 and -3 °C) stages and part of montagnard under Mediterranean influences (800-1,500-1,700 m, average temperature coldest month oscillating -3 to -7 °C). Altitude tranches vary by authors and especially by exposure, on adret (for highest) or ubac (for lowest); this is indeed preponderant, since limiting factor for vegetation is water availability. Another important regional characteristic is forest fragility to fires in summer and autumn. Thus, coastal massifs closed to circulation in summer to try preserving stands from fire. Firebreaks realized and maintained by sheep or planted with vines. **Thermoméditerranéen stage**, forming narrow discontinuous zone along Pyrénées-Orientales, Bouches-du-Rhône, Var, and Alpes-Maritimes coasts, occupied climacically by shrub formations with **wild olive**, **myrtle**, **lentisk**, sometimes mixed **holm oak**. **Mésoméditerranéen stage**, which follows, normally dominated by **holm oak**, quite often accompanied, even supplanted, by **pubescent oak** on deep soils, **cork oak** on siliceous soils, **Aleppo pine** in numerous situations, particularly after fire, or **maritime pine**, notably mésogéen, even **umbrella pine** on fixed dunes and in Maures Permian depression. On Provençal calcareous outcrops, Aleppo pine often accompanied by pistacia lentiscus; stand degradation leads to mosaic of garrigues with rosemary and grasslands with brachypodium ramosum for example. On siliceous substrates, pine forest gives way to open grasslands, heaths, cistus stands, or maquis with tree heather, myrtle, etc. Cork oak formations occupy siliceous substrates at stage base, essentially in Maures, Esterel, and Pyrénées-Orientales. Holm oak forests group several habitats: holm oak forest with arisarum (Arisarum vulgare) in mesophilic or ubac conditions, with lentisk, myrtle, etc.; mature holm oak forest with small-leaved helleborine and cephalantheras, near sites (abbeys) where forest protected, degraded elsewhere into holm oak forest with viburnum-tinus on calcareous rocks, with boxwood on very dry soils, or with ass's fern on siliceous rocks; holm oak forest with manna ash in more humid climate, in Alpes-Maritimes; holm oak forest with red juniper, installed in rock fissures, 100-800 m altitude. By degradation, holm oak forests evolve into garrigues, with kermes oak and rosemary notably, on calcareous substrates and into maquis, with strawberry tree and tree heather, on siliceous substrates. Pubescent oak formations observed in mésoméditerranéen stage throughout GRECO, 100-900 m, on deeper soils than those occupied by holm oak forest; can present varied facies and evolve differently depending on substrate, calcareous or siliceous. Salzmann pine stands observed, in Hérault, under elevated precipitation. **Supraméditerranéen stage** sees sclerophyllous-leaved broadleaves (holm oak) virtually disappear, mainly occupied by: pubescent oak formations, colonizing both calcareous and siliceous rocks, taking various facies linked to forest dynamics; chestnut formations on siliceous substrates. **Montagnard stage under Mediterranean influences**, occupying reduced surface in GRECO J mainly present in Southern Préalpes, essentially occupied by beech forests or dry calcicole beech-fir forests, well-represented calcicole to calcicline fir-beech forests or boxwood acidiphilous forests, Scots pine forests on adrets or crests, and some residual stands of rock with thurifère juniper. Riparian forests occupy watercourse major beds, composed of two main ensembles: softwood forests, pioneer, along minor bed: willows, willow-poplar stands, white or black poplar stands, alder stands; hardwood forests (where white poplar often persists), mature forests, often mixed, based on ash, elms, lime, pedunculate oak, hop hornbeam. In pré-ligure sector, between Nice and Menton, vegetation more thermophilic than in Catalano-Provençal sector: thermo-Mediterranean series with **carob**, lentisk, wild olive, arborescent spurge; climate mildness favored naturalization of numerous exotic plants, particularly on littoral.

**Geology & Terrain:** GRECO J geological history is complex, began >300 million years ago with successive sedimentations on Hercynian crystalline basement. Massif Central, Alps, and Pyrénées uplifts left their metamorphic imprints. Faults, erosion, and partial peneplanation of concerned basins conserved many initial calcareous terrains. However found in south are remains of Hercynian origin continent and in certain places zones of volcanic origin (Agde in Hérault, or Esterel massif). Seismic activity still exists today in Nice region. Thus, west to east, encountered: Roussillon hills, at Pyrénées foot, constituted of magmatic and metamorphic rocks; Roussillon plain, Camargue, plus Aude, Rhône, and Var valleys, sedimentary ensembles covered with alluvium of fluvial, fluvio-glacial, torrential, or marine origin dating from late Tertiary or Quaternary; typical rocky outcrops of Languedocian and Rhodanian plains, plus Provence calcaire, constituted principally of Urgonian limestones dating from Lower Cretaceous (Clape massif, pic Saint-Loup, Costières, Alpilles, Sainte-Baume, Luberon); Maures, Esterel, and Tanneron, essentially formed of metamorphic rocks dating from Primary era having undergone in places eruptive rock intrusions (Tanneron massif); eastern hills, constituted of Secondary and Tertiary sedimentary terrains: pudding stones, marnes, sables, and sandstones. West of Berre pond extends Languedocian plain, 20-30 km wide and <100 m altitude, little wooded except on some buttes not propitious to agriculture; its eastern limit is Comtat plain, remounting in Rhône valley to Valence. North and west of this vast flat expanse, relief, more disordered, formed of hills and slopes born during Pyrénées, Massif Central, and Alps uplifts. This hill zone also borders Aude valley into Minervois and Lauragais. Further east, scattered with higher summits, alternate depressions put into cultivation and elongated calcareous plateaus, covered by garrigue and dissected by narrow valleys from Massif Central. Average altitude 200-400 m, in Albères, Aspres, Fenouillèdes, Corbières, Cabardès, Minervois, Avant-monts, pic Saint-Loup, Costières, or Collines rhodaniennes. East of Berre pond, coastal plain much less wide, even non-existent, except in coastal river mouths. Coast is rocky and indented, altitude rises rapidly. Durance plain draws broad furrow amid calcareous plateaus to Sisteron. This zone comprises three distinct ensembles: **Provence calcaire**, composed of hills, plateaus, and calcareous chains interspersed with weakly undulating basins reserved for cultivation, going from Alpilles to Valensole plateau, limited north by Ventoux and Lure mountain, remounting to Sisteron via Durance valley; maximum altitude 1,200 m; **Maures massif**, composed of parallel reliefs oriented SW-NE, Esterel and Tanneron, with crystalline and metamorphic subsoil; **niçois and pré-ligure sectors**, with more humid climate and relief of plains and slopes hardly exceeding 1,100 m altitude, masking complex and varied geological structure and lithology. As soon as elevation occurs, landscape takes causse allures with typical Mediterranean vegetation, where exposure importance is preponderant.

**Landscape:** Mediterranean region landscape can decompose into three parts: 39% for forest, 37% for agricultural lands, 24% for heaths ensemble, "sans végétation," and continental waters. Given very dry climate and permeable, even sterile terrains, this last part occupies non-negligible place as forest doesn't meet necessary development conditions, and demographic pressure felt on Languedoc-Roussillon littoral and Côte d'Azur especially. From Roussillon to Berre pond, coastal plain virtually not wooded except on some buttes covered with wooded garrigues of oaks (cork oak, holm and pubescent oaks) mixed with umbrella or Aleppo pines amid often arid landscape. Cypress or Italian poplar windbreak hedges compartmentalize market garden crops, very important in this zone where population increases. But it's especially vine finding favorable conditions for development there, though since uprooting campaigns, olive groves today rehabilitated. From Berre pond to Nice, vegetation continuous and denser (Var department has France's highest wooding rate with Landes). Coastal forest descends to sea, but fragmented by important urbanization requiring organized forest surveillance. In Maures and Esterel massifs, north versant occupied by oaks and chestnut, strawberry trees, other shrubs, while pines largely dominate south versant. Crystalline substratum rocks gave birth to fairly poor siliceous soils, easily disaggregating giving saprolite mantle retaining water and permitting root penetration. Conversely, Permian depression soils on sandy mother rock, sandy and filtering, very favorable to umbrella pine and maritime pine. In Provence calcaire and niçois region, forests occupy only hills, buttes, plateaus, and zones where relief, often rocky and rugged, doesn't permit cultivation. Elsewhere, wooded garrigues hold important place. Exposure plays primordial role in vegetation distribution: Scots pine on crests and cooler north versants, maritime pine abundant on east-oriented versants, pubescent oak in valley bottoms, Aleppo pine and holm oak on warm versants. Holm oak and pubescent oak coppices occupy important surfaces. Open forests constitute large sylvopastoral ensembles, with strong juniper presence. Sainte-Baume beech forest with yew, situated 700-900 m altitude on north versant, where also found holly, obier-leaved maple, and large-leaved lime, is remarkable relict stand of GRECO J. On coastal edge, urbanism linked to growing demographic pressure is threat for forest often fragmented around cities in Languedoc-Roussillon and especially in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. Slopes, stony soils, and high parts of GRECO peripheral hills occupied by garrigue: low and often clear woody formations of Mediterranean species (cistus, heathers, strawberry tree, kermes oak, pistacia lentiscus, ...) interspersed sometimes with loose woodlands based on pubescent or holm oaks and accessorily Aleppo pine, colonizing essence. These woodland mediocrity is largely result of human pressure exerted there for millennia, climate dryness, and very low terrain thickness and rocky outcrop density. Some protected massifs bear denser pubescent oak coppices, where episodic beech and chestnut presence noted. At other GRECO limits, climatic and pedological conditions being better, woodlands denser and often better formed. In Cévennes, pubescent oak forest, appearing to be climacic formation, today very degraded, as low loose coppices, often mixed with holm oak. Conifer high forests generally of natural origin, with mainly Aleppo and umbrella pine, or artificial, then constituted of old reforestations in Austrian black and Corsican pines, with Mediterranean firs and Atlas cedar. Some punctual maritime pine massifs in Corbières, lower Cévennes near mining basins, and Roussillon implanted to reforest abandoned agricultural lands. Other more recent reforestations undertaken, with more/less success, to reconstitute fire zones with purely Mediterranean essences like Cephalonian fir or Spanish fir, plus usual essences: umbrella pine, maritime pine, Aleppo pine, and Atlas cedar. Finally, vast plantations with green space character created in 1960s around Languedocian littoral tourist stations to sanitize mosquito-infested lands and retain soils. Composed of white poplars and umbrella pines. Comprises **7 sylvoécorégions** (SER).

### K – Corse

**Climate:** Mediterranean type becoming montane with altitude. Marked by sunshine (>2,750 hours/year), luminosity, long summer drought, and strong autumn/spring precipitation. Corse is "mountain in sea," explaining this island's relative humidity, most watered of large Mediterranean islands. East or SE winds, often violent, push humid masses toward reliefs, where they condense giving abundant rains. Thus, NW part of island is drier. Average annual precipitation varies 500 mm at sea level to 1,000 mm toward 600 m altitude and 1,700 mm at 1,400 m. Above this altitude, precipitation can reach up to 2,000 mm/year. Average rainy days varies 60-115/year. Above 1,400 m altitude on north versant and 1,700 m on south versant, snow covers ground from late October to late May. But from 600 m, snow cover can be temporarily and locally important. Average annual temperature ~15 °C up to 300 m, 12.5 °C between 300-600 m, and 7 °C at 1,400 m altitude. Moreover, it increases from south to north. Rising in altitude, average annual temperatures decrease fairly rapidly, from 7 °C to 1.5 °C.

**Vegetation & Forests:** GRECO K: Corse is island constituting territorial collectivity composed of two departments: Corse-du-Sud (2A) and Haute-Corse (2B). Situated ~200 km from Côte d'Azur, it's most northern of large Mediterranean islands, and its insularity makes it original biogeographic entity. Corse belongs to Tyrrhenian sector (Corse, Sardinia, and Tuscan islands) of Mediterranean biogeographic domain defined by Habitat directive. Even if, in Mediterranean region, holm oak and cork oak forests resist relatively well to fires, fire frequency entrained degradation of these stands toward maquis dominated by strawberry tree and tree heather, preceding cistus stands, very easily flammable. Holm oak formations appear from thermoméditerranéen stage and occupy entire mésoméditerranéen. Pubescent oak, in mixture with hop hornbeam and manna ash, found essentially in supraméditerranéen stage. Chestnut, for its part, covers mésoméditerranéen and supraméditerranéen stages, notably in Castagniccia. **Montagnard stage** characterized by **Corsican pine (laricio)** stands of which some are prestigious like in territorial forests of Aïtone, Valdu-Niellu, Asco, Vizzavona, or Sorba-Marmano. These stands often pure, sometimes mixed with beech, birch, or fir or, more frequently, at lower fringe, with maritime pine (with pioneer behavior, notably after fire). Important part presents as loose woodlands on scree or at cliff base. Beech forests, plus some fir forests, more important in southern part. Alpine and subalpin stages (above 1,700 m), mainly localized in island north, devoid of forest vegetation on adret and sometimes occupied by fir or fragrant alder series on ubac. Simply found there are thorny heaths (dwarf juniper, Lobel's broom, Hermann's alkanet, Etna barberry), grasslands, fragrant alder bushes, or bare rock.

**Geology & Terrain:** Ridge oriented NNW-SSE, culminating at 2,710 m at Monte Cinto, of which ~10 summits exceed 2,000 m, compartmentalizes Corse into natural regions drawing characteristics from geographical position, morphology, soil nature, or vegetation particularities. From lithological and structural viewpoint, can distinguish four main ensembles: **Crystalline Corse**, forming island western part, covers alone >2/3, constituted essentially of magmatic rocks: granites, granulites, porphyries, or rhyolites. This ensemble formed half by four large mountain massifs and half by small plains or vast hill ensembles. These massifs are, north to south: Monte Cinto massif (2,710 m), island's highest summit, limited north/west by Balagne, east by Corte furrow, south by Vergio col and Golo valley; Monte Rotondo massif (2,622 m), situated between Vergio and Vizzavona cols, extending west via Ajaccio country hills, while Corte furrow limits it eastward; Monte Renoso massif (2,352 m), at once less elevated and more open than preceding, limited south by Taravo valley, west by Ajaccio country slopes, east by Fium'Orbo slopes; Monte Incudine massif (2,136 m), morphologically comparable to Monte Renoso massif, dominates Sartenais slopes and extends south via Cagna mountain, in appendix form oriented SW, culminating at 1,315 m altitude. **Schistose Corse**: At island NE, from Cap Corse point to Tavignano valley, schistes lustrés form substrate essential. Only added are some magmatic rock outcrops (gabbros, peridotites) often marking crests. Relief softer and less elevated than crystalline Corse, crests also less sharp, principal summits having altitudes varying 1,307 m at Monte Stello in Cap Corse to 1,767 m at Monte San Pedrone in Castagniccia. **Central depression**: Between schistose Corse and crystalline Corse extends narrow and long depressed zone axed on Corte furrow. This central depression which, between Tende country and Balagne, extends in NW direction to coast, opens SE on Aléria plain via Tavignano gorges. Contrasting with previous two large ensembles' lithological monotony, Corte depression appears as small sedimentary basin. Granites and schistes lustrés, still largely present, bear, especially north of Corte, vast Secondary or Tertiary cover remnants. Principal facies are Cretaceous clays, nummulitic pudding stones and limestones, and Miocene sandstones. **Eastern plain**: From Bastia to Solenzara, along eastern coast, backed by Castagniccia north and Renoso massif south, extends island's only large plain. Constituted of broad alluvial overlays covering Miocene sands and clays, this plain limited east by rectilinear sandy coast and sometimes lagoonal, contrasting with deeply indented rocky gulfs of western coast.

**Landscape:** Broadleaves largely dominant, since they are principal essence on 79% of Corse production forest surface. Central mountain principally occupied by laricio pine, fir, and beech series at montagnard stage. At altitudes <1,200 m, maquis holds important place; often tall with classic facies (oleaster, lentisk, and myrtle in low parts) and its various degradation stages, notably cistus stands. Generally mixed with holm oak which locally forms dense coppice or high forest patches, sometimes encompassing abandoned olive groves. Also classically found strawberry trees (France's largest) and tree heather. Vine occupies good part of agricultural lands, with olive groves, chestnut groves (in Castagniccia, principally), almond or citrus orchards, prairies, and market gardening. Holm oak largely represented but cork oak holds important place in landscape especially in Porto-Vecchio region, constituting vast cork oak forests and sometimes pre-woods. Maritime pine fairly frequent up to ~800 m and forms some beautiful stands toward Zonza side. Behaves as pioneer essence, sometimes competing with laricio pine, Corse's noble essence, representing 1/3 of island's conifer surface. Finally, some rare Aleppo pine stations present near Porto gulf, plus bracken fern heath. Very varied landscapes conserving savage beauty; wooding rate (55%) high, but wood production often low, particularly in maquis. Fire departure frequency higher than in other French Mediterranean regions. Comprises **3 sylvoécorégions** (SER). Represents **~3%** of France's forest area.
