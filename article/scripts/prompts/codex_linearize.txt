ROLE: Agent 1b — Outline Planner.

INPUTS:
- SPG: {{SPG_PATH}}
- Latest Gemini review JSON (if present) from {{REVIEW_DIR}}/
- Config: article/config/loop.yaml (outline_strategy={{OUTLINE_STRATEGY}})
- Guidance: article/docs/AGENTS.codex.md (outline policies)

TASKS:
1) Produce {{OUTLINE_PATH}} (YAML) with:
   - ABT at top (and/but/therefore)
   - contributions[] (3–5 bullets)
   - imrad.{Introduction,Methods,Results,Discussion} as paragraph bullets
2) For every bullet, reference the SPG node IDs it realizes, list the concrete artefact paths (results/**, article/images/**), and note which reviewer comments (if any) it addresses.
3) Emit a figure/table checklist and TODOs for missing artefacts under {{RESULTS_DIR}} or {{IMAGES_DIR}}; explicitly call out manuscript beats that Gemini flagged as unclear or unsupported.
4) Note which src/ pipelines or ops scripts must run to refresh stale artefacts (point to article_methods.json entries) and mark them as TODOs when required.
5) Flag in-line where reviewer requests require structural changes (e.g., new subsection, reordered evidence) so Claude can act on them.
6) Provide up to 2 alternative orderings (A/B) in the JSON summary, explaining when each variant should be chosen (e.g., emphasising calibration vs. operations or storytelling impact).
7) Adapt the outline to conform with the author guidance below—experiment with alternative framings or emphasis where helpful:

{{AUTHOR_GUIDELINES}}
========================

OUTPUT:
- Write YAML to {{OUTLINE_PATH}}; print JSON validating `article/scripts/schemas/outline.schema.json` with sections for checklist, TODOs, and alternative orderings (include readability/storytelling improvement tasks when relevant).
