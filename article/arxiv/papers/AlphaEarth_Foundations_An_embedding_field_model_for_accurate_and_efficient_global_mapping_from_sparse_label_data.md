**Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected around the world, but high-**
**quality labels remain scarce given the effort required to make physical measurements and observations.**
**This has led to considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels into**
**maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model yielding a highly general,**

**geospatial representation that assimilates spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple**
**sources, enabling accurate and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global**
**scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to consistently outperform a**
**suite of other well-known/widely accepted featurization approaches tested on a diverse set of mapping**
**evaluations without re-training. We have released a dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding**
**field layers from 2017 through 2024.**


### **Introduction**

Management of global food supplies, public
health, and disaster response all start from maps
that geographically anchor questions like "which
forests pose an unacceptable wildfire risk?" or
"where are soybeans grown?". The launch of
the first Landsat satellite in 1972 marked the
dawn of an era where spaceborne monitoring
could serve the interests of global environmental policy-making and provide critical insights
into our changing planet (Cohen and Goward,
2004). Over the following decades Earth observation (EO) data became widely available, and
streams from both historic and modern EO in
struments are now routinely used to create maps
that answer questions about the past, present,
and future of Earth’s ecosystems and climate
(Wulder et al., 2022). Nonetheless, advancements in deriving planetary-scale insights from
petabytes of satellite imagery and other environmental datasets remain hamstrung by the relative
scarcity of ground-based measurements and annotations, and a new problem: the overwhelming
volume of geospatial data (Tuia et al., 2024). In
this work, we introduce a foundational geospatial

embedding model that solves fundamental challenges in the institution of mapping through the
generation of a universal feature space. The features produced by our model consistently achieve
top performance in all application domains tested
when compared to other general and even domain specific approaches (Figure 1A). This marks
a shift from the previous state-of-the-art for which
no single approach was dominant.

### **From sparse labels to maps**


High-quality maps depend on high-quality labeled data, yet when working at global scales,
a balance must be struck between measurement

precision and spatial coverage. Many global mapping efforts focus on individual ecosystems like
forests (Hansen et al., 2013), water (Pekel et al.,
2016), tidal wetlands (Murray et al., 2022a) or
other broad legends, e.g., (Brown et al., 2022;
Zanaga et al., 2022). This simplifies the label
collection process, allowing trained interpreters
to collect larger volumes at scale at the expense
of descriptive power for certain use cases. In the
cases where high-quality annotations and/or field

evaluation shown, all available training data or the "max-trial" was used. Error bars indicate the 1 _𝜎_
best and worst case ratio or ∼ 90% confidence interval by bootstrapping and k-folds when possible.
Evaluations are sorted by increasing mean error ratio. The dashed line represents a ratio of 1 with
higher values indicating AEF outperforming the next best solution. (B) AEF reconciles multiple sparse,
non-uniformly sampled observation records into a continuous record, regardless of fluctuations in
availability. AEF "embedding fields" are a result of static temporal summaries drawn over a conditional
"valid period" that need not fully intersect the "support period", where the latter defines the temporal
range of the input data. Multiple raster and scalar measurement sources are modeled as sources or
targets by AEF. These may be any combination of temporally, geographically, and spatially sparse. In
the example shown here, NLCD is not present, and GEDI is available in only a sparse fraction of the
spatial context. (C) A view of our global embedding field for the year 2023, note apparent climatic
gradients at large scales. (D) AEF produces highly resolved features at 10m [2], shown here plotting
arbitrary axes in Oaxaca, Mexico. (E) A stack of 64 rasterized AEF layers forms an embedding field,

measurements are available, systematic coverage is usually much more localized, e.g.,
(d’Andrimont et al., 2020; Lister et al., 2020; Nagy
et al., 2021). Accurate and efficient scaling of
such highly-detailed yet spatially and temporally
sparse data remains an open challenge, e.g., (Sun
et al., 2021).


A natural approach to better leveraging sparse
observations is to isolate the relevant informa
tion content of the feature space used to generate maps. Designed EO features like vegetation
indices (Zeng et al., 2022), best-available-pixel
composites (White et al., 2014), 1D harmonics
(Wilson et al., 2018; Zhu and Woodcock, 2014),
and kernel-based filters (Haralick et al., 1973;
Lee et al., 2017) power many of the map data
products used for policy making, e.g., (Brown
et al., 2020; Wulder et al., 2024; Zanaga et al.,
2022). When heuristics are carefully chosen,
they can offer an efficient mechanism for geographically extrapolating labels and measurements. However, designed features are often
noisy, sensor-dependent, and highly region- and
application-specific, compounding the challenges
inherent to working with satellite imagery and
other planetary-scale datasets.


Machine learning has revolutionized fields
from biochemistry to natural language understanding. Unsurprisingly, combining disparate
EO sources through the use of machine learning has become an active area of research (Rolf
et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2017). A new generation of geospatial foundation model approaches



can be roughly characterized as derivatives of
SatMAE (Cong et al., 2022) or implicit models
such as SatCLIP (Klemmer et al., 2025). While
these approaches represent progress in the application of ML to EO data, none satisfy all of
the following key properties: (1) multi-source
or multi-modality, (2) inclusion of time into the
modeling framework, or (3) spatial resolution at a
precision useful for serving operational mapping
use cases. Critically, as we will show, existing
learned featurization approaches don’t always
outperform designed featurization methods in
scarce data regimes.

### **AlphaEarth Foundations**


AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF) is the only learned
EO featurization approach to outperform a representative sample of featurization methods tested
across a broad set of sparse data domains (Figure 1A), reducing error magnitudes by ∼ 23.9%

∼
( 1.4x error magnitude reduction) on average
while maintaining a best-in-class 10-meter spatial resolution that requires 16x less information
per-representation (64 bytes) compared to the
next-most compact learned method. We achieve
this leap in performance across challenging mapping applications through a number of innovations; namely, we employ an adaptive decoding
scheme that considers time and sensor parameters as continuous variables in an implicit decoder
with associated losses, a spatially dense information time-bottleneck, time-conditional summarization, and spatially-precise alignment with geo

tagged text from Wikipedia articles joined with
locations from Global Biodiversity Information
Facility (GBIF) species occurrence records. To
the best of our knowledge, AEF is the first EO featurization approach to support continuous time
(Figure 1B; see supplemental materials S2.2.1).
Additionally we introduce a challenging evaluation suite composed of high-quality reference
data that attempts to faithfully replicate realistic mapping scenarios. We make our annualized
planet-scale feature maps or "embedding field"
layers (Figure 1C-D) and evaluation suite available under an open license to encourage further
exploration and use.


AEF is designed to accept _𝑁_ _𝑖_ frames for _𝑖_ ∈ _𝑀_ _𝐸_
input (encoded) data sources with _𝐶_ _𝑖_ channels
resampled to the same spatial resolution, and a
millisecond epoch timestamp _𝑡_ _𝑗_ _,_ 1 ≤ _𝑗_ ≤ Σ _𝑁_ _𝑖_ (Figure 2A). The range of the input timestamps we
refer to as the “support period”. For the purposes
of learning or at inference time, we support a pair
of conditioning timestamps or “valid period” _𝑡_ _𝑠_ _, 𝑡_ _𝑒_
where _𝑡_ _𝑠_ _< 𝑡_ _𝑒_ provides a temporal summary of the
Earth’s surface and climatic activity over [ _𝑡_ _𝑠_ _, 𝑡_ _𝑒_ ),
even when there is no _𝑡_ _𝑗_ for which _𝑡_ _𝑠_ ≤ _𝑡_ _𝑗_ _< 𝑡_ _𝑒_ (interpolation), or when _𝑡_ _𝑒_ ≤ _𝑡_ _𝑗_ _,_ ∀ _𝑗_ ∈{ 1 _,_ 2 _, ...,_ Σ _𝑁_ _𝑖_ }
or _𝑡_ _𝑠_ _> 𝑡_ _𝑗_ _,_ ∀ _𝑗_ ∈{ 1 _,_ 2 _, ...,_ Σ _𝑁_ _𝑖_ } (extrapolation).
These summaries or “embeddings” are 64 bytes
in size, and each embedding contains information that reproduces the temporal trajectory of
variables listed in Table S1 over the summary period (Figure 2B) using conditional metadata from
each source (see supplemental materials S2.2.1).
By explicitly separating the input intervals from
those used for the temporal summary, we can apply AEF to time dependent problems requiring a
precise date range without fine-tuning. Embeddings are further constrained to distribute uniformly in _𝑆_ [63] using a so-called “batch uniformity”
objective (Figure 2C; see supplemental materials
S2.2.4).


Our video summarization architecture must

simultaneously maintain highly localized representations as well as model long distance relationships through time and space in a computationally efficient way; for this we’ve designed an
encoder termed Space Time Precision or “STP”
that consists of repeated blocks of three simulta


We train a trio of neural network models that

work in tandem: a teacher video embedding
model with implicit decoders, a student video
embedding model sharing the same parameters
and architecture as the teacher, and a text alignment model (Figure 2E). We trained ∼ 1B and

∼
480M parameter variants of AEF, and ultimately
proceeded with the smaller variant for improved
inference efficiency. We discuss the training set,
model training, and architecture in greater detail in supplemental materials S2. The results of
running inference at scale are “embedding fields”
tiling Earth’s terrestrial surface in approximate
10m [2] grids (Figure 2E).

### **Evaluation in realistic data-scarce sce-** **narios**


To establish the performance of AEF relative
to other learned and designed representations,
we required an evaluation dataset that included
archetypal examples of realistic mapping applications. These include thematic mapping, biophysical variable estimation, and change detection at
annual and sub-annual cadences. We found most

mark suites provide annotations at an object- or
image-level rather than pixel-level, rely on labels sampled from existing (machine-generated)
datasets, require running the benchmark analysis using provided source imagery, have limited
geographic coverage, and/or do not provide sufficient spatial precision or temporal information,
e.g., (Bountos et al., 2023; Lacoste et al., 2023),
limiting their value in assessing practical use.


To address the need for high-quality labeled
datasets that can be used to simulate low-shot

(i.e., tens to hundreds of samples) performance
in data-scarce regimes requiring precise map
outputs, we developed a set of 15 evaluations
sourced from 11 openly available datasets. These
datasets were selected to represent archetypal
classification, regression, and change detection
use cases, with all datasets directly linked to realworld products and applications, including land
use/land cover mapping and change detection,
crop type mapping at different hierarchies, tree
genera and plantation classification, and estimating evapotranspiration and emissivity at national
to global scales (Table 1). For each evaluation
dataset, we selected a balanced number of training samples from each class or equally-spaced
partition, with the number of samples determined
based on the minimum class size (Table 1, Max
Trial Size) and the remainder of the dataset reserved for testing. We then assess performance
across a suite of trials designed to test very-low
shot training sizes with _𝑛_ samples per class ( _𝑛_ = 1,
10, max) via transferal methods with minimal parameters: k-nearest neighbors, and linear layers
fit to the features (see supplemental materials
S4). The “max-trial” scenario is meant to represent more realistic sparse dataset sizes (hundreds
as opposed to thousands or millions of points),
whereas the ten and one shot trials are meant to

evaluate performance given extreme data sparsity.


We used this set of evaluations to compare
AEF with a representative set of domain-specific
baselines specifically designed for Earth observation applications, including three designed featurization approaches: CCDC (Gorelick et al.,
2023; Zhu and Woodcock, 2014), MOSAIKS (Rolf
et al., 2021), and composites (Qiu et al., 2023),



and three learned featurization approaches: SatCLIP (Klemmer et al., 2025), Prithvi (Jakubik
et al., 2023b), and Clay (Clay, 2024). We also
include three controls: spatial coordinates (XY),
coordinates and elevation (XYZ), and a ViT (Vision Transformer) pre-trained on ImageNet (Deng
et al., 2009; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). Where applicable, baselines were provided with identical
inputs to AEF and baseline hyperparameters were
tuned to maximize performance on our evaluation suite (see supplemental materials S5).


Our evaluations showed AEF consistently outperforms both designed and learned featurization
methods in all trial settings. AEF reduced error
magnitudes overall by ∼ 23.9% on average when
compared to the next-best approach and method
of transfer in the max-trial setting (Figure 1A).
For ten-shot trials, AEF reduced error magnitudes
by ∼ 10.4% on average compared to the next-best
approach, and for one-shot trials AEF reduced error magnitudes by ∼ 4.18%. We show quantitative
and qualitative results for select evaluations in
Figure 3 (and see supplemental materials S6 for
full quantitative results). The next-best approach
varies across evaluation dataset and method, indicating both non-uniform progress and that AEF
unlocks progress in historically challenging mapping scenarios. We discuss these results and the
effect of scaling training data in further detail
below.

### **Thematic mapping**


Thematic mapping or "semantic segmentation"
refers to spatially-dense discrete classification
over an area. We group 11 classification evaluations into thematic mapping applications including land use, land cover, crop detection, crop
type, and species distribution mapping. These
classification datasets vary in their number of
classes, complexity of semantics they represent,
and their summary periods, i.e., instantaneous observations versus persistence over a reference period (Table 1). Assessing max-trial performance
in Figure 1A, we find that AEF achieves the greatest error reductions for evaluations over annual

periods: e.g., LCMAP land cover, Descals oil palm,
Africa crop mask, and LCMAP land use. Other

than Ethiopia crops, all thematic mapping evaluations had > 1.0x reductions in error within

the ∼ 90% confidence interval. AEF’s consistent
performance across these diverse evaluations
suggests a degree of generality that was previously not possible even with higher-dimensional
learned embeddings.

### **Estimating biophysical variables**


The estimation of biophysical variables goes beyond problems of semantics and perception. Effectively extrapolating sparse measurements of
properties not easily observed in satellite or other
overhead imagery stands to benefit applications
from greenhouse gas emissions to the heating/cooling impact of crops. We consider two biophysical variables: emissivity, which is a unitless
measurement of surface radiation, and evapotranspiration, which characterizes loss of water to the
atmosphere from Earth’s land surface. In the maxtrial setting, we find that all baselines were able
to explain emissivity for some method of transfer with _𝑅_ [2] - 0.5 except for xy, xyz, and CCDC.
AEF had the highest _𝑅_ [2] (0 _._ 72 ± 0 _._ 00), followed
by MOSAIKS (0 _._ 69 ± 0 _._ 00). In characterizing
evapotranspiration, AEF demonstrates a significant departure from the other baselines tested
being the only method with _𝑅_ [2] _>_ 0 _._ 2, achieving _𝑅_ [2] = 0 _._ 58 ± 0 _._ 01 (Figure 3). We note that
the two baselines with explanatory power in this
evaluation, composites and MOSAIKS, are simple
transformations from raw satellite data, indicating a gap in applicability of both learned and
designed featurization approaches prior to AEF.

### **Change detection**


Responses to natural and man-made disasters,
illegal logging, and other emergent phenomena
rely on effective and timely regional monitoring.
We consider two approaches to embedding-based



change detection: _direct classification of change_,
which treats change between two summary periods as a binary label and trains the same supervised models used above, and _unsupervised_
_change detection_, which characterizes a continuous magnitude of deviation from an expected
value and thresholds this to generate a change
mask (see supplemental materials S4.1). Our
change evaluations are a variant on the LCMAP
labels used for thematic mapping that combines
labels from different years to produce a binary
label indicating whether or not a change in use
or cover has occurred. For comparisons we omit
the XY and XYZ controls and SatCLIP baseline as

these are time-invariant.


In the max-trial setting with direct supervision
of change, we find that AEF’s performance exceeds performance of other models and datasets
achieving 78 _._ 4% ± 1 _._ 11 balanced accuracy (BA)
(linear) and 79 _._ 3% ± 1 _._ 67 BA (kNN, k=3) on the
land cover and land use evaluations respectively.
The next-best baseline achieved 72 _._ 0% ± 1 _._ 28

BA (MOSAIKS, kNN, k=3) and 71 _._ 5% ± 2 _._ 33 BA
(composite, kNN, k=3) respectively. In the maxtrial setting with unsupervised thresholding, AEF
exceeds performance of all other baselines when
detecting land cover change (Figure 3), but not
land use change, achieving 71 _._ 3% ± 1 _._ 14 BA and
71 _._ 4% ± 2 _._ 08 BA compared to 67 _._ 0% ± 1 _._ 28 BA
(ViT) and 72 _._ 9% ± 1 _._ 97 BA (ViT) respectively,
suggesting the value of supervision for this use

case.

### **Scaling source data quantity and type**


The AEF training dataset includes over 3 billion
observations across nine different gridded data
sources and one unstructured text source, and
represents approximately 1.1% of Earth’s land
surface area (see supplemental materials section
S2.1). We find that increasing the number of
unique observations used to train AEF leads to

other approaches when trained on the same number of unique observations or fewer. From published
documentation, SatCLIP uses 100k observations, Prithvi 4.2M observations, and Clay 70M. (B) The

more performant embeddings (Figure 4A). For
some evaluations (LUCAS land use, Africa crop
mask), performance saturated between 100 million and 1 billion observations, whereas for others
the saturation point was not obviously reached
(US trees). AEF performance generally exceeds
that of approaches trained with an equivalent
number of observations across all evaluations,
and always outperforms other evaluations with
the full training set. A noteworthy outlier is US
trees for which AEF requires an additional ∼ 100x
observations compared to SatCLIP, which we speculate is related to AEF receiving no coordinate
information, therefore requiring more examples
to learn climate gradients.


We hypothesized that the number of distinct data sources and observation modalities

used in training would positively correlate with
model performance. To test this, we categorized the sources into the following groups: Optical (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8/9), Radar (Sentinel1, PALSAR2), LiDAR (GEDI), Environmental
(GLO-30, ERA5-Land, GRACE), and Annotated
(NLCD, Wikipedia) and iteratively added additional groups to training. We find AEF the most
performant when trained on the full set of source
groups, though with diminishing returns as additional groups are added (Figure 4B).

### **Global embeddings dataset**


To facilitate usage of AEF by EO practitioners, we
have produced a collection of annual embedding
summaries generated by AEF and hosted it as an
image dataset on Google Earth Engine (Google,
2025). For many use-cases we expect these annual embedding fields to revolutionize mapping
workflows that typically require large training
datasets, compute intensive models, and custom
inference systems to apply those models. To further minimize compute and storage overhead,
we quantize the 32-bit floating point embeddings
generated by AEF to 8 bits, resulting in an 4x
reduction in storage with negligible impact on
performance (see supplemental materials S8 for
additional details on inference and quantization).


### **Conclusions**

AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF) combines a multitude of diverse geospatial observation records
into a time-continuous embedding space by precisely modeling temporal dynamics and relationships across sources. By separating information
pertinent only to the act of measurement from
the mutual information across all sources, we are
able to compactly describe Earth’s surface properties while maintaining robustness to the noise
and sparsity inherent to Earth imaging missions.


Our findings indicate that AEF consistently outperforms designed and learned featurization approaches in relatively sparse data regimes and
that AEF embeddings are broadly applicable to a
diverse range of fields such as biodiversity, ecology and agriculture. For these fields, obtaining
maps to model both spatial and temporal changes
efficiently is of key importance even when large
annotation corpora are not available. As new measurement platforms are launched, others decommissioned, and the accelerating pace of observational data collection pushes forward, we believe
it is critical to support the community of applied
scientists and practitioners deriving the insights
about our planet that inform decision-making and
policy action. With AlphaEarth Foundations, we
introduce a solution to accurately and generally
extrapolate annotations and field measurements
to the growing archives of Earth observation now,
and into the future.

### **Supplementary Material** **S1. Data sources and preprocessing**


AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF) was trained on
both image and text data sources representing
a diversity of imaging modes and measurement
spaces (Table S1). All raster data sources were
sampled from the Earth Engine Data Catalog
(Gorelick et al., 2017), and we prioritized publicly
available, moderate-resolution datasets covering
the period 2017 to present. As text served more
as an auxiliary task, only English Wikipedia was
used for sourcing text data. Source dataset characteristics and sensor-specific preprocessing steps
are described in the following sections.


We reproject all raster data to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates followed by
spatial resampling to 10 m resolution using bilinear interpolation. We rescale pixel values to zero
mean and unit variance using per-band statistics
computed on the pretraining dataset, clipping values with magnitude larger than 6 standard deviations post-scaling. We do not perform any masking at the input stage, instead using the valid data
masks to exclude masked pixels when computing
the loss. Unless stated otherwise, at bare minimum, millisecond acquisition timestamps were
saved as metadata used during reconstruction.


**S1.1. Sentinel-2 (optical)**


Sentinel-2 is an optical remote sensing mission
from the Copernicus Program that collects moderate spatial resolution (10 m to 60 m) multispectral imagery over land (Drusch et al., 2012).
Sentinel-2A was launched in June of 2015, with
Sentinel-2B to follow in March of 2017. With a

two-satellite constellation, Sentinel-2 is able to
image the Earth once every 5 days at the equator.



We sample imagery from the Sentinel2 Level-1C (L1C) collection (COPERNICUS/S2_HARMONIZED), which has been
processed to Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (Gascon et al., 2017). All images are
processed in their source UTM projection and
datatake identifiers are used to remove duplicate
observations at the boundaries of Sentinel-2 tiles.

Given additive storage requirements for each
new band selected, we select a subset of bands to
use for analysis, specifically the blue, green, red,
near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared bands:
"B2", "B3", "B4", "B8", "B11". To ensure a more
even distribution of reflectance, we transform
Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 pixel intensities
using the following formula (prior to standard
scaling):


_𝑠_ ( _𝑥_ ) = [lo][g][(] _[𝑥]_ [+][ 1][)] (1)

10


where x is the source pixel intensity.


We include the Cloud Score+ (Pasquarella
et al., 2023) "cloud score" (cs) band as a mask
with each Sentinel-2 image, binarized to 0 / 1
by thresholding at 0.5. Mask information is only
used during training, no input compositing or
masking is performed, and mask information is
not provided to the model at inference time.


**S1.2. Landsat 8 & 9 (optical, thermal)**


The Landsat Program, a joint initiative of the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) and
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), has provided detailed, synoptic depictions of the Earth’s surface for over fifty years
(Wulder et al., 2022). Landsat 8 was launched in
February 2013 (Loveland and Irons, 2016) with
Landsat 9 to follow in September 2021 (Masek
et al., 2020). These satellites both carry separate
optical and thermal instruments, and resulting
images include a 15-meter panchromatic band,
eight 30-meter optical bands, and two 100-meter
thermal bands. Individual Landsat satellites have

a revisit time of 16 days, and an 8-day revisit is
achieved when two satellites are operating concurrently. Landsat provides another high-quality
multi-spectral optical record that is complemen

tary to those acquired by the Sentinel-2 mission,
providing additional image frames, as well as the
addition of thermal information.


We exclusively use Collection 2 Tier 1 TOA
imagery (i.e., "LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_TOA",
"LANDSAT/LC09/C02/T1_TOA"), which have the
highest available data quality (terrain corrected,
well-calibrated radiometry, intercalibrated across
sensors), and we remove ascending (nighttime)
imagery by filtering based on sun angle metadata. Acquisitions were deduplicated based on
time proximity, i.e., at row overlaps, preference
is given first to the image with the closest UTM
central longitude, then the most recent. As with
Sentinel-2, we select a subset of Landsat bands,
specifically the Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR,
RGB Panchromatic, Thermal IR bands: "B2", "B3",
"B4", "B5", "B6", "B8", "B10". We also include the
FMASK pixel quality bitmask ("fmask"). All optical bands are log-transformed. The "fmask" value
is set to 1 when the pixel is not "dilated cloud"
or "cloud shadow", and 0 otherwise based on the
value of the QA_PIXEL band. Mask information
is only used for training.


**S1.3. Sentinel-1 (C-band SAR)**


Sentinel-1 is the Copernicus Program’s C-band
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission (Torres
et al., 2012). Sentinel-1 instruments are designed
to collect dual-polarized observations with several different imaging modes. Notably SAR instruments are water vapor (cloud) penetrating, and
offer consistent ground measurements in the tropics or other persistently cloud areas. The Sentinel1 constellation consists of two satellites, Sentinel1A and Sentinel-1B, which were launched in April
2014 and April 2016, respectively (Potin et al.,
2016). The Sentinel-1B mission ended in December 2021 due to a power system failure, resulting in incomplete coverage (and illustrating
challenges of continuity when working with Earth
observation records).


We use Ground Range Detected (GRD) images
("COPERNICUS/S1_GRD"), which have been processed using the Sentinel-1 Toolbox to generate
a calibrated, ortho-corrected product. We select images acquired in the Interferometric Wide



Swath (IW) instrument mode and include both
ascending and descending orbits. We include all
available bands: "VV", "VH", "HH", "HV", "angle",
though noting that each scene contains only 1 or
2 out of 4 possible polarization bands depending
on the instrument’s polarization settings (i.e., VV,
HH, VV+VH, HH+HV). Processed power values
are log-scaled to convert to decibels (dB). The
angle band is included on all images and is converted from degrees to radians.


We additionally mask pixels with values less
than -30.0 dB or greater than 10.0 dB. We retain
metadata on platform heading and orbital inclination for use as reconstruction metadata. During
training, we also introduce random gap artifacts
as a form of data augmentation to simulate gaps
that sometimes occur between Sentinel-1 scenes

by sampling an angle uniformly at random and
masking out a line of intensities with random
width between 0.5 and 2 pixels at that angle in
all Sentinel-1 images in an input sequence. These
gaps are in-painted during reconstruction.


**S1.4. PALSAR-2 (L-band SAR)**


The Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS2) is the radar satellite operated by the Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) which carries PALSAR-2 (Phased Array type L-band SAR2), an L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
instrument (Kankaku et al., 2013). L-band is a
longer wavelength radar signal with greater ability to penetrate through dense vegetation, compared with the C-band frequency measured by
Sentinel-1, which tends to be more sensitive to
sparse and low biomass vegetation, e.g., (Koyama
et al., 2022).


We use PALSAR-2 ScanSAR

("JAXA/ALOS/PALSAR-2/Level2_2/ScanSAR")
imagery, which is ortho-rectified and radiometrically terrain-corrected. We include all
available bands: "HH", "HV", "LIN". Most images
have horizontal polarization ("HH"), vertical
polarization ("HV"), local incidence angle ("LIN"),
and QA mask ("MSK") bands are always present,
though a small subset (<8%) has only HH. We
convert the intensity values from digital numbers
(DN) to decibels using:


21


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



_𝛾_ 0 = 10 ∗ log 10 (DN [2] ) − 83 _._ (2)


We rescale local incidence angle (lin) to radians. Observations are deduplicated based on path,
and we preserve metadata on Pass Direction and
Antenna Pointing for use in reconstruction.


**S1.5. ERA5-Land (climate)**


As part of the Copernicus Climate Change Service
(C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has produced an enhanced global
dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), referred to
as ERA5-Land (Muñoz-Sabater et al., 2021).The
ERA5-Land dataset is intended to provide a consistent view of the water and energy cycles at
surface level.


We sample the ERA5-Land Monthly aggregation ("ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/MONTHLY_AGGR"),
which is a post-processed subset of the full ERA5Land dataset consisting of monthly statistics (Service, 2019). Specifically, we select total precipitation (sum, min, max), temperature at 2-meters
(mean, min, max), dewpoint temperature at 2
meters (mean, min, max), and surface pressure
(mean, min max) variables to represent general
climatic conditions.


**S1.6. GEDI (LiDAR)**


The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation
(GEDI) is a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
mission launched by NASA to the International
Space Station (ISS) in 2018 (Dubayah et al.,
2022). LiDAR sensors like GEDI use laser pulses
to estimate vegetation profiles, which can in turn
be used to map canopy height and vegetation
biomass, e.g., (Campbell et al., 2021; Potapov
et al., 2021).


We use the GEDI L2A Raster

Canopy Top Height (Version 2) dataset
("LARSE/GEDI/GEDI02_A_002_MONTHLY")
(Dubayah et al., 2021) This dataset is a rasterized
version of the original Geolocated Elevation and
Height Metrics Product (GEDI02_A) product,



which is primarily composed of 100 Relative
Height (RH) metrics that describe the heights
at which a given energy quantile was received
by the GEDI instrument. We sample all relative
height bands (RH[0-100]), and we mask out
pixels where the ISS was busy or the waveform
was bad based on the "degrade_flag" and "quality_flag" metadata. GEDI is extremely sparse in
space/time compared to our other raster sources,
nonetheless we find AEF’s reconstruction of the
full set of GEDI relative height metrics to have
mean absolute error ∼ 3.85m during training,
including sampling from the noisy bottleneck.


**S1.7. GRACE (gravity fields)**


The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment
(GRACE; launched 2002, decommissioned 2017)
and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO; launched
2018) both consist of a pair of satellites working in tandem to take detailed measurements of
Earth’s gravity field anomalies (Kornfeld et al.,
2019; Tapley, 2008). These measurements can
be used to detect changes in the distribution of
water across the planet and estimate terrestrial
water storage (Landerer and Swenson, 2012). We
considered the inclusion of GRACE an extreme

test of the flexibility of our method, and were
pleased to note that there was no significant negative impact on the loss or reconstruction quality
of other sources.


We use GRACE Monthly Mass Grids Release
6.1 Version 3 - Global Mascons ("NASA/GRACE/MASS_GRIDS_V03/MASCON
_CRI"). This dataset was derived from GRACE
and GRACE-FO and processed at JPL using the
Mascon approach (RL06.1Mv03) and an additional Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter to reduce errors across coastlines. We specifically sample the equivalent liquid water thickness
("lwe_thickness") band, which represents the total
terrestrial water storage anomalies from soil moisture, snow, and surface water (including rivers,
lakes, reservoirs, etc.), as well as groundwater
and aquifers in units of centimeters. Given the
very coarse resolution of the GRACE data (0.5° or
about ~55 km at the equator) relative to other
moderate-resolution sources, we apply an additional upsampling and downsampling step with


22


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



bilinear resampling to smooth pixel borders.


**S1.8. GLO-30 (topography)**


The Copernicus 30-meter global Digital Elevation Model (DEM), referred to as GLO-30, is a
Digital Surface Model (DSM) that characterizes
the surface of the Earth including buildings, infrastructure and vegetation. The GLO-30 dataset
is primarily derived from an existing TanDEMX DSM dataset (WorldDEM™) infilled on a local basis with other widely used DEMs including
SRTM, ALOS, ASTER and TerraSAR-X. It is generally considered the most accurate, up-to-date
radar-derived global DEM, e.g., (Guth and Geoffroy, 2021; Simard et al., 2024).


We sample the DEM (elevation) band from the
GLO-30 dataset ("COPERNICUS/DEM/GLO30").
Slope and aspect are calculated from the DEM
after it is reprojected into the local coordinate
system (UTM), and decomposed into sine and
cosine. The GLO-30 DEM is assumed to be valid

over the entire period of our training set, though
we note with natural and man-made phenomena
this is not universally true.


**S1.9. NLCD (land cover)**


The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) is a
suite of products developed for operational land
cover monitoring in the United States. These
machine-generated thematic maps are derived
from 30 meter multi-season Landsat imagery and
rely on a carefully curated training labels, handengineered spatial, spectral and temporal features, and classic machine learning (i.e., decision
trees), as well as rigorous post-processing and accuracy assessment (Wickham et al., 2014, 2023).
We include NLCD in our list of source datasets as

a means of testing the value of existing maps as
a form of weak supervision. We note that there
was no significant negative impact on the loss or
reconstruction quality of other sources, and the
effect on evaluations was generally positive despite the temporally-static nature of NLCD (see
supplement section S7.2 for ablation results).


We use the 2021 release for the year 2021 ("USGS/NLCD_RELEASES/2021_REL/NLCD"), and



the 2019 release for all other years ("USGS/NLCD_RELEASES/2019_REL/NLCD"), and
all samples are associated with the nearest
mapped year (if sample date falls in between
NLCD release years). We select the "landcover"
band, which labels 16 land cover classes using
a nested hierarchy. As noted in Figure 1, NLCD
data is not available for all locations globally.


**S1.10. Text sources**


Towards truly multi-modal (as opposed to strictly
multi-source) embeddings, we assume that
geocoded text can provide additional context that
will help enrich our learned representations. We
use two sources for obtaining locations and associated text: Wikipedia and the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF) species occurrence
records.


**S1.11. Wikipedia**


We use geolocated articles from Wikipedia to provide text-based information for things like landmarks and other geographic features. We extract
all articles with coordinates (using the P625 - coordinate location Wikidata property) from the
2024-04-21 snapshot of Wikipedia, with additional filters on the "globe" property to remove
articles with "extraterrestrial" coordinates. We

also drop articles with fewer than 100 words (including title and headers) or where more than
25% of the total words in the article are con

External Links sections were omitted, and any
non-plain-text content was omitted.


**S1.12. GBIF**


We obtain species occurrence records through
GBIF occurrence dataset available through BigQuery (GBIF, 2024). We specifically select
records in the Plantae, Animalia and Fungi kingdoms for the period 2017-2023. Observations
must be available by CC-BY 4.0 or CC0 1.0 license, be labeled as human or machine observations, have a maximum spatial uncertainty of
240 meters, and meet a number of other criteria
to remove invalid or otherwise suspicious coordi

nates, bad date information, and uncertain taxon
matches. Post-filtering, we limit our sampling to
a maximum of 1000 observations per unique family, genus, species observation tags. We export the
observation coordinates and timestamp together
with the GBIF taxonomy ID for species, genus,
family, and potentially also higher taxonomic levels, as well as the coordinate uncertainty to use
for sampling corresponding video embeddings.
Finally, we match observations with a subset of
Wikipedia articles using the GBIF taxon ID property (Wikidata P846) after normalizing the observation’s GBIF ID to the accepted ID for its taxon.

### **S2. Modeling**


**S2.1. Training Dataset**


AEF was trained over 8,412,511 video sequences
containing interleaved, time-stamped frames
from the sources and metadata listed in supplemental materials S1. Each frame covered a 1.28

km x 1.28 km (128 x 128 pixel) area projected
into the UTM zone of the area’s centroid and

were not limited in length: all available data was
used totalling 3,047,520,515 frames. Video sequences were sourced from 5,145,244 sites, and
each site was split into two non-overlapping approximately year-length periods from which two
video sequences were drawn. Sequences were
omitted for a variety of factors, including missing
data in e.g., polar regions and insufficient frames
from a particular source e.g., at swath edges. We
make these training locations available in (DeepMind, 2025b).


_**S2.1.1. Training site selection**_


Our global AEF training dataset was developed
to provide a representative sample of Earth’s terrestrial land surface and near-shore ecosystems,
while optimizing for coverage across space, time,
and availability of data sources.


**Gridded text** Our sampling strategy prioritizes
coverage of locations where we have geocoded
text information by first taking a gridded sample
that covers these locations. Our final geocoded
text dataset includes point locations for GBIF



species observations and other geotagged features from Wikipedia (as described in supplemental materials S1.10) plus a key to join these locations with associated text embeddings. The locations represented in this dataset inevitably inherit
the same sampling biases as the source GBIF and
Wikipedia data, i.e., locations tend to be clustered in areas with denser human populations
/ more urbanized areas. To account for these
spatial biases, we do not sample each Wikigeo
location individually; instead, we establish a sampling grid such that multiple Wikigeo locations
are associated with the same (non-overlapping)
image samples. We use 1.28 km x 1.28 km as our
base grid cell size and create grids in the native
UTM projection of the zone intersected by the
sampled points. Our final gridded text dataset
includes centroid coordinates for 1,200,099 grid
cells, representing 8,777,536 text points.


**RESOLVE ecoregions** The gridded sample does
not fully represent the global land surface, so we
use the 2017 RESOLVE Ecoregions dataset ("RESOLVE/ECOREGIONS/2017") (Dinerstein et al.,
2017) to draw an additional random stratified
sample by ecoregion ID. This helps ensure we
are sampling across distinct biogeographic assemblages and ecological habitats with uniform
preference regardless of total extent. We use the
ECO_ID (n=846) and target 10,000 samples per
ecoregion, then cull based on standard 1.28 km
minimum distance requirement (i.e., remove sampled points that are too close together and/or too
close to gridded text samples). This generated a
total of 3,940,224 unique ( _𝑥_, _𝑦_ ) locations based
on ecoregion stratification.


**Near-shore ecosystems** We supplement our initial RESOLVE sample, which largely targets terrestrial ecosystems, with additional stratified samples from the Allen Coral Atlas and Global Intertidal Zones datasets to improve representation
of near-shore ecosystems. The Allen Coral Atlas
("ACA/reef_habitat/v2_0") maps the geomorphic
zonation and benthic habitat for the world’s shal
low coral reefs at 5 m pixel resolution, as well
as a global reef extent product that maps additional reef areas unable to be explicitly included


24


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data


in the geomorphic and benthic mapping (Lyons
et al., 2022, 2024). We resample the Atlas from
5 meter to 30 meter resolution, then draw a random sample of 5,000 points. After deduplicating,
the final supplemental coral sample consists of
4,141 locations. We also add samples from the
Murray Global Intertidal dataset (Murray et al.,
2019, 2022a,b). The binary layers in this image
collection depict tidal flat ecosystems around the
global coastline. As with corals, we initially target
5,000 samples, which reduces to a final count of
2,968 intertidal samples after applying our 1.28
km minimum distance criteria.



**Proposed (** _𝑥_ **,** _𝑦_ **) locations** We merge the four
aforementioned samples (gridded text, ecoregions, corals, and intertidal) into a single dataset.
We then reduce the number of samples over the
“rock and ice” to n=500, preferentially targeting
removal of samples from Antarctica and Greenland (priority to keep examples in high-altitude
over high-latitude). We also remove samples over
open water, i.e., 128 x 128 pixel image chips that
would not sample anything other than offshore
water, as we don’t expect the model to learn much
from these examples and it reduces redundancy
among text points associated with offshore observation transects. After these final filtering steps,
our sampled location dataset consists of a total of
5,145,244 unique ( _𝑥_, _𝑦_ ) locations (Figure S1A).


_**S2.1.2. Adding time coordinates**_


To ensure that our sample also represents temporal variability in surface properties, we sample
two temporal (support) periods per site. This has
the added benefit of also effectively doubling the
size of our training sample. The general temporal
processing strategy is as follows: if there are no
Wikigeo points present, a site can select any two
non-overlapping periods in the sampling years.
If there are points, we pick two periods to maximally allocate point date ranges that intersect
those periods such that a point is allocated to
only one of the two periods. Upon selection of
the periods, we create a final dataset bearing all
observations with all period bounds (two periods for each site). From this, we create our final
collection of ( _𝑥_, _𝑦_, _𝑡_ _𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡_, _𝑡_ _𝑒𝑛𝑑_ ) coordinates, which

resulted in a total of 10,203,798 unique rows that
moved on to data source collection.


_**S2.1.3. Training sample**_


Our source data distillation system is designed to
sample image sources for ( _𝑥_, _𝑦_, _𝑡_ _𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡_, _𝑡_ _𝑒𝑛𝑑_ ) seed locations while accounting for sensor-specific minutia and geospatial attributes (i.e., projections).
Some seeds (and associated imagery sequences)
are ultimately dropped due to low (or no) image
availability, i.e., some targeted locations may be
outside coverage for one of our key inference sensors (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat). In total,
we drop 1,791,287 sequences from our initial set
of seeds, and ultimately exclude samples from
Antarctica due to lack of sufficient Sentinel-1 imagery; while no single source is required for inference, training rows require all input sources
to be present so they can be artificially dropped.
This resulted in a final pretraining dataset representing 8,412,511 unique ( _𝑥_, _𝑦_, _𝑡_ _𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡_, _𝑡_ _𝑒𝑛𝑑_ ) coordinates (Figure S1B), and consisting of a total
of 3,047,520,515 individual image frames (see
Figure S2 for breakdown by sensor). Training
data rows were stored with all pixel data, mask
and sensor metadata, and text and geometries
intersecting the row physical area in a sharded
format designed for rapid loading during training

**S2.2. Training algorithm**


_**S2.2.1.**_ _**Simulating a continuous observation**_
_**record**_


It is critical that embeddings should encapsulate
temporal dynamics. In practice this means the
resulting embedding can differentiate between
similar surface conditions with different temporal
ordering; for example differentiating between
fields with the same crops where the planting
happened at different times.


For time conditional summarization following
STP, we produce a temporal summary leveraging time-axial attention pooling based on a single
learned query feature derived from the valid period [ _𝑡_ _𝑠_ _, 𝑡_ _𝑒_ ) following a conversion to sinusoidal
timecodes. This summary is up-sampled to size L
using a learned kernel. We then introduce a variational bottleneck with a key innovation: rather
than collapse the output spatially, we estimate the
mean direction across an _𝐿𝑥𝐿_ grid of von MisesFisher (VMF) distributions in _𝑆_ [63] . This bottleneck
construction permits a high degree of spatial precision without the further fine-tuning that is typical of other unsupervised embedding models,
and provides a mechanism to parameterize the
"smoothness" of a given embedding manifold via
the VMF concentration.


AEF is trained to conditionally decode embeddings from the bottleneck. For each of _𝑖_ ∈ _𝑀_ _𝐷_ decoded sources, a small decoder network accepts



an embedding, and a set of conditional metadata
specific to that source (Figure 2B). Typically this
is at least a sinusoidal timecode representing an
instant in the valid period [ _𝑡_ _𝑠_ _𝑖_ _, 𝑡_ _𝑒_ _𝑖_ ) normalized to

[ 0 _,_ 1 ), though may also contain orbital geometry
and metadata that is only relevant to the act of
measurement, not the measurement itself. The
source decoder network is applied to every location in the output grid to produce an _𝐿𝑥𝐿_ reconstruction _𝑦_ _𝑖_ [′] [, one for each] _[ 𝑖]_ [∈] _[𝑀]_ _[𝐷]_ [with] _[ 𝐶]_ _[𝑖]_ [channels.]
Interestingly, these decoders have the effect of
generating spatially continuous predictions for an
arbitrary timestamp (e.g., dense, superresolved
LiDAR profiles from GEDI). We update the parameters in the entire network to minimize the error
between _𝑦_ _𝑖_ [′] [and] _[ 𝑦]_ _[𝑖]_ [, a target source frame ran-]
domly selected to intersect the valid period and
potentially held out of the inputs. The error metric varies depending on the source, and accounts
for spatial misregistration of the instrument, missing data, and _𝑦_ _𝑖_ [′] [vs.] _[ 𝑦]_ _[𝑖]_ [resolution mismatches as is]
the case when our nominal embedding resolution
(10 _𝑚_ [2] ) does not match the source’s original resolution. We minimize cross-entropy loss for categorical sources, and L1 error for non-categorical

sources.


Another unique requirement of working with
EO data is that our model must be robust to the

highly sparse nature of EO data sources. To reduce swath and tiling artifacts during learning,
we utilize an additional forward pass or "student" model trained alongside the "teacher" as
described above. The student’s input frames are
randomly dropped, and some input sources are
removed entirely. A key insight is that simply augmenting the teacher’s inputs in this way does not
influence the objective function to reward yielding near-identical outputs in the same location
and same time period regardless of input composition. We minimize 1 minus the dot product
between the teacher and student embeddings,
both conditioned on the same valid period, and
the teacher and student share parameters.


_**S2.2.2. Learning algorithm**_


Unlike other work pursuant of general geospatial modeling (Tseng et al., 2023), we opted to
minimize the number of sources used as model in

26


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



puts to improve performance and avoid ill-posed
reconstruction problems where e.g. climatic information must inform reconstruction of radar

data. We found Sentinel-2 L1C, Sentinel-1 GRD,
Landsat-8 C2 T1 TOA, and Landsat-9 C2 T1 TOA
to be the minimal set providing satisfactory reconstructions across all sources. Inputs were normalized based on global image statistics and no
further value modification or augmentation was
performed.


Training proceeded using stochastic mini-batch
gradient descent to minimize the following objective function with respect to model parameters:



_𝑙_ = _[𝑎]_

metadata and the observation timecode, and a
small decoder is applied at each pixel embedding
to reconstruct the selected frame. Losses are com
puted against this reconstructed frame, with the
nature of the loss _𝑓𝑖_ changing depending on the
source _𝑖_ ∈ _𝑀_ and a source-specific weight (Table
S2).


Shift-invariant loss computes the minimum error metric across any planar shift in reconstruction up to the specified distance. Re-gridding loss
re-grids the reconstruction and target using areaweighted averaging to the given nominal resolution before computing the error metric. All losses
utilize per-frame per-pixel weights to account for
swath edges and invalid pixels; decisions around
derivation of weights and masks from source data
are detailed in supplemental materials S1.


We set the weight of the overall reconstruction
objective _𝑎_ = 1 _._ 0.


Reconstructions each randomly selected summarization periods [ _𝑡_ _𝑠_ [′] _𝑖_ _[, 𝑡]_ _𝑒_ [′] _𝑖_ [)] [ for source] _[ 𝑖]_ [∈] _[𝑀]_ _[𝐷]_ [s.t.]

tive, a different embedding corresponding to the
unique summarization period is generated, and
the target timestamp is normalized to this period
on [ 0 _,_ 1 ) . We use the embedding and normalized timecode to reconstruct source i, alongside
any source specific metadata specific to the act of
measurement detailed in supplemental materials
S1.


_**S2.2.4. Batch uniformity objective**_


To increase the utilization of our embedding
space, we introduced an objective to encourage
the uniform distribution of a given embedding
vector over _𝑆_ [63] . Since, on average, random vectors on a sphere will be orthogonal (Cai et al.,
2013), we can treat this as a necessary condition
for our uniformity constraint. Across a batch of
image-space embedding vectors **u**, we can rotate
this vector through the batch dimension to get **u** [′] .
Assuming a uniform sample from the training set,
batch element pairs _𝑢_ _𝑖_ and _𝑢_ [′] _𝑖_ [are effectively uni-]
form random sample pairs from the training set,
and we can compute an overall "orthogonality"
across the batch:


27



Indicated by weights a, b, c, d of the linear
combination, the loss components are:


(a) Reconstruction objective with _𝑓_ _𝑖_ varying as a
function of data source.

(b) Batch uniformity objective encouraging a
uniform distribution over the training set of
embeddings in _𝑆_ [63]

(c) Contrastive consistency objective: encouraging model forward passes with missing inputs to yield embeddings identical to forward
passes without missing inputs.
(d) Text contrastive objective: align embeddings
derived from text descriptions with embeddings derived from the video sequence.


Loss weights were normalized prior to training.


_**S2.2.3. Reconstruction objective**_


To facilitate learning, in each row a frame was randomly selected from each source sequence. For
sequences serving as model inputs these frames
were removed from the input sequence directly.
Randomly selected frames, and their corresponding metadata and timecode, are then used for
computing reconstruction losses. The model’s
embedding output is concatenated with sensor

_**S2.2.5. Consistency objective**_



Earth observation data is irregular in space and
time. Acquisition campaigns are not always
global, have acquisition periods unique from
other instruments, vary as a function of solar angle, come on and offline for a number of reasons,
and atmospheric conditions at the time an observation is made are unpredictable at local scales.
As our model is intended to produce continuous
embedding fields over arbitrary regions of Earth’s
surface, it is crucial that we reduce the effect of
these space and time varying irregularities. Unlike purely supervised models we cannot rely on
labels to help reduce noisy artifacts. Additionally,
we need to ensure that our model provides consistent embeddings for a location regardless of
the condition of the inputs as we want to model
Earth’s underlying landscape dynamics not the

measurement process.


To achieve this, we run our forward pass twice.
We utilize a teacher model that has access to all

inputs, and a student model that has its inputs
perturbed. Perturbation proceeds in two stages:


1. Entirely drop a source from the inputs. The
Landsat Group is randomly dropped 30%
of the time, and Sentinel-1 GRD is dropped
30% of the time. Sentinel-2 L1C is never

dropped.
2. Select one of three perturbation strategies:


(a) Randomly drop time-steps across all

We minimize this batch uniformity term during training. We note that alone, there are perfectly valid non-uniform distributions for which
this tends to zero e.g. clusters of points on opposite poles. In practice, setting the weight in
the loss combination for this term > 0 prevented
collapse scenarios where this term would tend to
1 otherwise. We ultimately settled on a weight of
_𝑏_ = 0 _._ 05.


While tuning was not performed, as expected,
evaluation scores improved when batch uniformity was present, or there was no difference. To better understand the effect of batch
uniformity, we performed a sweep of _𝑏_ ∈

[ 0 _,_ 0 _._ 001 _,_ 0 _._ 005 _,_ 0 _._ 01 _,_ 0 _._ 1 ] . We found settings of
_𝑏_ = 0 and _𝑏_ = 0 _._ 1 to be the least performant
across evaluations, and _𝑏_ = 0 _._ 005 to be optimal.
For some evals, the difference in performance was
notable e.g. GLanCE land cover max-trial linear
transfer BA scores were ~66.6% for _𝑏_ = 0 _._ 005

and ~64.7% for b = 0. For others, there was
only a small improvement e.g. LUCAS land cover
max-trial linear transfer BA scores were ~34.7%

for _𝑏_ = 0 _._ 005 and ~34.2% for _𝑏_ = 0.


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



sources. 30% of images from the Landsat Group are randomly dropped, 30%
of images from Sentinel-1 GRD are
dropped, and 50% of images from
Sentinel-2 L1C are dropped.
(b) The latter six months of the input sequence across all sources is dropped
(forecasting-like).
(c) The former six months of the input sequence across all sources is dropped
(backcasting-like).


If perturbation strategy (a) is used, we choose
a unique, random summarization period [ _𝑡_ _𝑠_ [′] _[, 𝑡]_ _𝑒_ [′] [)]
s.t. _𝑡_ _𝑒_ [′] [−] _[𝑡]_ _𝑠_ [′] _[>]_ [ 4 days intersecting the annual period]
of the non-perturbed inputs. If strategy (b) is
used, we choose a summarization period across
the latter six months of the input sequence. If
strategy ( _𝑐_ ) is used, we choose a summarization
period across the former six months of the input
sequence. We note sequence start and end times
are not aligned to any calendar unit.


The student and teacher model now embed

their inputs based on the shared summary period.
The teacher must produce an embedding that the
student can mimic with limited inputs while the
student must produce an embedding that agrees
with the teacher. Given teacher embeddings and
student embeddings s, we minimize:


_𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_ = [1][ −] _[𝝁]_ [·] _[ 𝝁]_ _[𝑠]_ (5)

2


We set the weight of the overall contrastive objective _𝑐_ = 0 _._ 02 to balance reconstruction visual
quality and maximize student / teacher agreement. We note that while considerably reduced,
tile artifacts are still visible in our embedding
fields layers resulting from irregular inputs, and
these could be removed in future work with a

more aggressive consistency objective term.


_**S2.2.6. Text-contrastive objective**_


We co-train with a frozen language model (Gemini et al., 2024) with the goal that embeddings
characterizing points on Earth’s surface with similar semantics will cluster together.


All points and corresponding text intersecting



a training row’s geometry and date range were
stored with the row. During training, a random
text point is selected if available, and we choose a
unique random summary period [ _𝑡_ _𝑠_ [′′] _[, 𝑡]_ _𝑒_ [′′] [)] [ s.t.] _[ 𝑡]_ _𝑒_ [′′] [−]
_𝑡_ _𝑠_ [′′] _[>]_ [ 4 days intersecting the annual period of the]
teacher model’s inputs. We condition an MLP
decoder on the language model’s output with
this summary period to produce an embedding
aligned with the teacher model using standard
CLIP loss (Radford et al., 2021).


We set the weight of the overall text-contrastive
objective _𝑑_ = 0 _._ 001.


**S2.3. Model training**


AEF was trained for 56 hours on 512 TPU v4
devices over 100k steps in batches of 256 video
sequences. Training was sharded by batch, and
further by sequence s.t. two TPU v4 devices were
allocated to each batch element. Input sequences
were subsampled from the training row to 103
frames ( _𝑁_ _𝑖_ ), comprising 65 Sentinel-2 L1C, 17
Sentinel-1 GRD, and 21 Landsat Group observations. Masks were substituted for unavailable or

perturbed frames (see supplemental materials
S2.2.3).


Learning utilized the Adam optimization strategy (Kingma, 2014), with a piecewise linear
learning rate schedule from 0 to 1 _𝑒_ −4 over

[ 0 _,_ 1 e 3 ) steps, then 1 e−4 to 0 over [1 e 3 _,_ 1 e 5 ] .
Learning hyperparameters were selected to minimize training loss while maintaining satisfactory reconstruction visual quality, stability in the
contrastive and batch uniformity objectives, and
desired performance on a set of diagnostic evaluations designed to assess whether embeddings
could distinguish the presence of specific input

sources.


**S2.4. Architectural details**


We used a model dimension of _𝐷𝑃_ = 128 along
the precision path, _𝐷𝑇_ = 512 along the time path,
and _𝐷𝑆_ = 1024 along the space path. 15 STP
blocks were used in total. Implicit decoders were
two-hidden-layer MLPs with a width of 512. The
VMF bottlenecks utilized a fixed concentration
( _𝜅_ ) of 8e3.


29


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data


### **S3. Evaluation datasets**

We assess AEF performance using a set of evaluation datasets we derived from ten publiclyavailable reference datasets representing archetypal classification, regression, and change detection use cases (Table 1).


**S3.1. Selection criteria**


We selected publicly available datasets to represent a range of different real-world classification,
regression and change detection applications. We
did not generate any of our own annotations
for these evaluations; rather, we identified existing datasets that represented high-quality observation/measurement information and could
be used with minimal processing. We prioritized reference datasets with human-assigned
interpretations or physical measurements over
model-generated predictions. In some cases (like
OpenET), we do include “model proxy tasks”
that sample model-generated predictions, but
these were selected with strong justification, e.g.,
proxying a computationally intensive ensemble
approach. We generally avoided harmonized
datasets that combine multiple sets of annotations initially collected with differing protocols/criteria since this makes it more difficult to understand/interpret results/errors. Given we are
evaluating a global model, we attempted to construct an overall suite with large area / global
coverage. We preferred point measurements or
annotations over polygons, since reasoning about
labels for a specific point rather than over a larger
area is more straightforward, and this simplifies
sampling of embeddings and other feature vectors for comparisons across approaches. We only
selected datasets where point coordinate data
(longitude, latitude) in decimal degrees was sufficiently precise relative to a nominal 10-meter
resolution, i.e., at least four decimal points of
precision (0.0001), which is about 11.1m at the
equator. Given our focus on temporal precision,
we also required that labels have a clearly defined
“valid period” over which the label could be reasonably applied, i.e., a range or instant (annual,
monthly, single-date), and this period must intersect 2017 onward, and we ensured that we



had representation of different temporal aggregations across our final set of evaluations (Table
1). For all candidate datasets, we required that
the georeference of a given annotation was not
tied to a specific observation. In the spirit of typical computer vision benchmarks or evaluations,
many recent general purpose geospatial evaluations provide source imagery (see Schmitt et al.
(2023) for review), though we argue this is not
appropriate for assessing general purpose geospatial analysis approaches that may leverage time
and additional sources uniquely. Were we to require that all baseline approaches tested share
the same sources, many would be artificially penalized or would not have been usable at all. As

most observational data is tied to a ground truth,
not a specific measurement, we argue that future
geospatial benchmarking work moves towards
evaluations with precise timing and without requisite inputs. We present our evaluation suite as
an example of such.


**S3.2. Processing**


All reference datasets were processed to the standard format and properties in Table S3. In some
cases, e.g., LCMAP, LUCAS, and Canada crops,
multiple evals were created using different hierarchies or combinations of source labels, resulting
in a final total of 15 derivative datasets (Table 1).
Point observations were filtered to guarantee a
minimum distance of 1.28 km between sampled
points in order to reduce spatial autocorrelation
between training and test sites (and this process
will be hereafter referred to as “spatial proximity
filtering”). Sample points were allocated to train
and test splits such that the training datasets were
balanced by class (or regularly spaced bins in the
case of regression datasets), with no per-class
sample exceeding 300 points and the remainder
of the points allocated to an unbalanced test split.
When possible, we used existing Google Earth
Engine assets for publicly available datasets; otherwise reference datasets were downloaded from

archived sources. Additional details on sources

and processing for individual datasets are provided in the following sections, and we make our
processed evaluation datasets available as a supplemental dataset (DeepMind, 2025a).

**S3.3. Evaluation datasets**


_**S3.3.1. LCMAP**_



LCMAP (Land Change Monitoring, Assessment,
and Projection) is a USGS project aimed at generating annual land cover and land cover change
maps for the United States (Brown et al., 2020).
The LCMAP CONUS Reference Dataset is a col
lection of human-interpreted labels for 27,000
30m x 30m plots across CONUS, which includes
an initial sample of 25,000 randomly distributed
points and a supplemental sample of 2,000 stratified random "intensification" sites (Pengra et al.,
2023). Land use, land cover, and change process
information for each plot are available for annual
timesteps for the year 1984 to 2021.


We use the LCMAP reference datasets, which
include multiple label properties and distinct
legends, to create two classification datasets
(LCMAP land cover and LCMAP land use) and two
change detection evaluation datasets (LCMAP
land cover change and LCMAP land use change).
These datasets are representative of the contiguous United States (CONUS; Figures S3 and
S4), and we take performance on LCMAP subdatasets as indicative of performance for operational national-scale land use and land cover

mapping and change detection.


**LCMAP land cover & LCMAP land use** The

LCMAP land cover and land use evaluation

datasets are based on the "dominant_landcover"
and "dominant_landuse" fields in the source
LCMAP dataset. The LCMAP land cover legend
includes six broad cover-type classes (Table S4),

while the LCMAP land use legend includes an alternative set of six land use categories (Table S5).
The full LCMAP dataset includes labels for all

sample locations across all years; we subset the
full set of interpretations to 2017-2021 to overlap
with our period of interest, and randomly select
one year from the time series of labels for each
sample point (based on the ’image_year’ property). We sample a total of 300 points from each
label class, with the remaining points allocated to
the test split. For all points, the valid period (i.e.,
the period over which embeddings are generated/summarized) is assumed to be January 1 of
the "image_year" from the source dataset through
January 1 of the following year. Our final LCMAP
land cover evaluation has a total of 1800 training points and 24,710 test points, while our final
LCMAP land use evaluation also has a total of

1800 training points and 24,713 test points after
pre-processing and spatial proximity filtering.



**LCMAP land cover change & LCMAP land**
**use change** Though the source LCMAP dataset
includes change process labels, we generated new change labels directly from "dominant_landcover", "dominant_landuse", and "image_year" fields for parity with the LCMAP classification evaluations. We again subset the full
reference dataset to 2017-2021 to overlap with
our period of interest. We then label pairs of sequential years where the label is not consistent
(i.e., yeart and yeart+1 have different labels) as
“change” and years with consistent labels as “no
change”. We select only one year-pair for each reference point, and we sample a total of 300 points
per class for land cover change (Table S7) and
150 points per class for land use change (Table

S6). Because we want to compare embeddings
for two annual labels, we set a valid time start and
end for both the before and after periods, where
both periods are one year in length from January
1 to January 1 of the following year and assigned
based on the "image_year" property in the source
dataset. Our final LCMAP land cover change evaluation has a total of 600 training points and 1,720
test points, and our final LCMAP land use change
evaluation has a total of 300 training points and
691 test points after pre-processing and spatial
proximity filtering.


_**S3.3.2. LUCAS**_


The LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey) was designed to gather information on land cover and land use updated via
regular harmonised surveys across all European
Member States in the survey years 2018 and
2022/2023 (Toth et al., 2013).The survey includes over 250,000 sample points throughout
the EU (Figure S5), and the survey is repeated
every few years to identify changes to land use
and cover. One of the primary purposes of the
LUCAS dataset is to generate estimates of the


33


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data


**LUCAS land cover** Our LUCAS land cover evaluation uses the "lc1" label. After the initial filtering
described above, we additionally checked that the
‘lc1’ label is not null, and that percent cover for
the "lc1" label ("lc1_perc") is classified as "50 - 75
%" or "> 75 %". This results in a label dataset

with 40 land cover classes (Table S8). We assume
land cover represents an instantaneous observation of state, so we set the valid time to the time at
which the land cover observation was made (i.e.,
time start = time end). We select 300 points per
class for training and assign the remainder to the
test split (Table S8). Our final LUCAS land cover
evaluation has a total of 12,000 training points
and 191,569 test points after pre-processing and
spatial proximity filtering.



Figure S5 | Distribution of LUCAS survey points.


area occupied by different land use or land cover
types. Given the high level of detail in LUCAS,
and the ground-based nature of its collection, we
consider LUCAS a challenging assessment of how
well a set of geospatial features distinguish detailed ground-level concepts.


We use the LUCAS Harmonized (Theoretical
Location, 2006-2018) V1 dataset (d’Andrimont
et al., 2020) sourced from the Earth Engine Data
Catalog ("JRC/LUCAS_HARMO/THLOC/V1").
We filter the full LUCAS dataset to keep only
survey data intersecting our period of interest
(year greater than or equal to 2017, and
with a location precision of at least 10 meters
("gps_prec" less than 10). We exclude points
labeled as ‘ex_ante’ given this indicates they
were not visited in a given survey year. Finally,
we keep only classes with at least 420 samples.



**LUCAS land use** Our LUCAS land use evalua
tion uses the "lu1" label. We apply the same initial
filtering as we do for land cover. We also check
that the ‘lu1’ label is not null, and that percent
cover for the lu1 label ("lu1_perc") is classified
as "50 - 75 %", "75 - 90 %", "> 90 %". This results in a label dataset with 15 land use classes

(Table S9). We assume land use represents an
integrated observation of state (e.g., "forestry"
may include periods of tree cover, clearing, and
regrowth), so we set the valid period to a oneyear window centered on the time at which the
land use observation was made, i.e., six months
prior, six months after. As with land cover, we
select 300 points per class for training and assign
the remainder to the test split (Table S9). Our
final LUCAS land use evaluation has a total of
4,500 training points and 222,358 test points after pre-processing and spatial proximity filtering.


_**S3.3.3. GLaNCE land cover**_


The NASA-funded Global Land Cover Estima
tion (GLanCE) project seeks to provide highquality long-term records of land cover and land
cover change at a 30m spatial resolution for the
21st century (2001 to present) (Friedl et al.,
2022). The GLanCE training dataset was designed for regional-to-global land cover and land
cover change analyses (Stanimirova et al., 2023).
Similar to LCMAP, the dataset legend is intended
to support a broader community of end-users;

however, the GLaNCE dataset is a global sample (Figure S6). Thus, we consider the GLaNCE
dataset a good proxy for general-purpose global
(as opposed to national) land cover mapping.



Our GLaNCE evaluation dataset is derived

from the GLanCE training dataset in the
GEE Community Catalog ("projects/sat-io/opendatasets/GLANCE/GLANCE_TRAINING_DATA
_V1") (Roy et al., 2025). Though published
GLaNCE data products use Level 1 labels (Arevalo
et al., 2022), we use the Level 2 of the labeling
hierarchy ("Glance_Class_ID_level2") as a test of
maximizing thematic detail. Given that GLaNCE
includes a number of other datasets, some of
which overlap with other evaluation datasets, e.g.,
LCMAP, we select a subset of sources, specifically the MODIS STEP dataset (STEP), results
of spectral-temporal clustering (CLUSTERING),
a labeled dataset from the NASA Arctic-Boreal

Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), and a set
of annotations collection by the project team
("Dataset_Code" = 1, 2, 4, or 704). GLaNCE
labels are associated with time segments, i.e., labels have a start and end date similar to our use

of a valid period. We select only labeled segments
with an end year after 2017 ("End_Year" greater

than or equal to 2017). We remove null values as
well as the "ice_and_snow" and "moss" categories,
which have fewer than 500 samples per class. This
results in a final dataset with eleven classes, and
we select 300 training points per class with the
remainder allocated to the test split (Table S10).
Though we note that segments could be converted
to a series of annual labels for each location, this
approach would be subject to greater temporal
autocorrelation across labels for the same loca
tion; instead, we sample a random year between
segment start and end dates as an annual valid
period to ensure more independent sampling of
the time domain. Our final GLaNCE land cover
evaluation has a total of 3,300 training points
and 31,585 test points after pre-processing and
spatial proximity filtering.


_**S3.3.4. Africa crop mask**_


Our Africa crop mask evaluation was derived from
a manually-labeled reference dataset designed
to validate the accuracy of cropland maps derived from land cover maps (Kerner et al., 2024a).
The dataset includes pointwise (binary) annotations for cropland versus non-cropland in eight
Sub-Saharan African countries (Kenya, Rwanda,
Uganda, Tanzania, Mali, Malawi, Togo, and Zambia; Figure S7). For all countries except Mali,
where the percentage of cropland area is small,
reference points were selected by drawing a ran

dom uniform sample of point locations within
each country’s boundaries. For each sample,
trained individuals inspected images from each
month in the country’s growing season to determine whether the point contained active cropland, defined as "points where patterns of sowing, growing, and/or harvesting in an agricultural field could be observed during the relevant
agricultural season within a 12-month period"
(Kerner et al., 2024a). At least two annotators
labeled every point to maximize label confidence,
and points that did not have unanimous agreement between annotators were discarded to en
sure high-confidence labels in the final reference
dataset. We consider the Africa crop mask reference dataset a good proxy for general agricultural land use in landscapes where there has been
notable disagreement among existing mapping
efforts.

We accessed the crop mask reference datasets
for individual countries as Earth Engine assets
provided by the authors ("projects/bsos-geogharvest1/assets/harvest-reference-datasets/*"),
though we note that these datasets are also
available as archived shapefiles (Kerner et al.,
2024b). We merge separate datasets for Kenya,
Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Mali, Malawi, Togo,
and Zambia into a single dataset and assign
labels based on the “crop_label” field. We use an
annual valid period covering Jan 1 2019 to Jan
1 2020 for all countries except Malawi, where
reference labels are for 2020, so we use a valid
period of Jan 1 2020 to Jan 1 2021 instead. Our
final Africa crop mask evaluation has a total of
400 training points and 2,156 test points after
pre-processing and spatial proximity filtering
(Table S11)


_**S3.3.5. Canada crops**_


The Canadian AAFC (Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada) Annual Crop Inventory Ground Truth
Data is an annual field-by-field inventory of Canadian crops (Agriculture and Canada, 2024). It
does not cover the whole country; rather, a "windshield survey" is done annually for provinces
where crop data is not provided to provincial
crop insurance companies (Figure S8). This data
was originally collected as training and validation points for use in the AAFC Annual Crop Inventory (ACI, which looks at state and trends in
national agriculture production. We create two
evaluation datasets at two different levels of classification hierarchy, which we refer to as Canada
crops coarse and Canada crops fine. We assume
that these datasets are a good proxy for performance on multi-level crop classification at a national scale, and unlike reference datasets that
rely on interpretation of imagery, the windshieldsurvey approach indicates performance scaling
sparse ground-based observations from national

locations.


inventory datasets.


We downloaded prepackaged shapefiles for the
years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022
(2023 data was also available but formatting was
not consistent with other years, so we dropped
from consideration). Processing for the two subdatasets (coarse and fine) are described in the
following sections.


**Canada crops (coarse)** We use the Landuse
Category Code (CATCODE) and corresponding
English Landuse Category Name (CATNAME) to
derive our Canada crops coarse evaluation. We
impose a minimum overall per-class sample size
of n=100, and cull any classes that do not meet
this minimum count requirement. Given the class
distribution is highly imbalanced and includes
several classes with less than 200 samples per
class, we set a proportional split rather than a
fixed sample, allocating 60% to training and reserving 40% for testing and re-sampling as part
of the evaluation process to re-balance the training set (Table S12). We treat the observations
as instantaneous and assign the Date Collected
(DATE_COLL) as the valid period start and end
(single-date). Our final Canada crops coarse evaluation has a total of 2,831 training points and
13,248 test points after pre-processing and spatial
proximity filtering.


**Canada crops (fine)** For the Canada crops fine
evaluation, we use the Landuse Code (LAND

CODE) and associated English Landuse Name
(LANDNAME). These species-level labels present
an excellent opportunity to characterize performance on highly detailed legends and viability
for agricultural use cases that require this level of
detail. However, many categories have few samples, and some categories may be too noisy to
draw any sound conclusions about performance
(particularly the “Undifferentiated” categories,
which could include examples of the same crop
type but grouping different phenologies already
represented individually).

After these merges and removals, we check to
ensure remaining categories have a viable number of samples (greater than 100 per class). As
with Canada crops coarse, there is a high degree
of variability in per-class sample sizes, so we use
a proportional rather than fixed per class sample size, allocating 60% to training and 40% to
testing and re-balancing the training set using
repeat sampling during training. We again treat
window survey observation as instantaneous and
assign the Date Collected (DATE_COLL) as the
valid period start and end (single-date). Our final
Canada crops fine evaluation has a total of 5,565
training points and 9,001 test points after preprocessing and spatial proximity filtering (Table
S13).


_**S3.3.6. Ethiopia crops**_


The Ethiopian Crop Type 2020 (EthCT2020)
dataset is a benchmark for environmental and

agricultural remote sensing applications in complex Ethiopian smallholder wheat-based farming
systems (Blasch et al., 2024). The dataset consists of harmonized, quality-controlled, and georeferenced in-situ samples of annual crop types
(Blasch, 2024). Like the Canada crops inventory,
these in situ samples represent an important class
of sparse-but-high-quality data, and we take additional steps to process this dataset for consistency
with our evaluation dataset protocols and standards.


We downloaded the dataset from Mendeley
(Blasch, 2024). Per the dataset description, this
shapefile contains the delimitation of 2,793 circular plots (10 m radius) located in cultivated
fields, and the crop information (crop group and
crop class) of the 2020/21 main Meher season
(June 2020 to February 2021) for each field plot.
Given close proximity of many of the interpreted
sites, we do not simply remove points to satisfy
minimum distance criteria. Rather, we create connected components by joining points within 1.28
km radii, and assign points to the train or test
split based on their component membership.This
avoids the scenario where a train and test point
are in the same spatial neighborhood. Component membership assignment is performed to minimize the number of points off from which all

classes have allocated 20% of their points to their
train split, though the large size of some components lead to an imbalanced result. Given our

evaluation protocol sub-samples to the minimum
class size this was not problematic. We lastly remove all datapoints with crop classes that have a
total of < 49 train points. The valid time is treated
as instantaneous (single-date) and set to the data
collection timestamp, ("sub_dat") from the original dataset. Our final Ethiopia crops evaluation
has a total of 873 training points and 1,657 test
points after pre-processing and spatial proximity
filtering (Figure S9, Table S14).


_**S3.3.7. US trees**_


To evaluate performance on biodiversity-related
applications, we leveraged the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF) records, specifically
research-grade observations from the iNaturalist
citizen science repository (GBIF, 2024). GBIF is
a comprehensive collection of species occurrence

Figure S10 | Distribution of US trees sample locations.


records. Unlike our text pretraining dataset, here
we focus on genus-level taxonomic labels (as opposed to alignment with text embeddings for the
information associated with a given species). We
chose to focus on tree genera in the United States
given interest in forest species composition mapping across a diversity of forest types (Figure
S10).


We select GBIF records for the period Jan 1
2017 to Jan 1 2023 and filter to just observations
where the genus label is found in a list of tree
genera sourced from the US Forest Service and
country code is set to the US. Observations must
be labeled as human or machine observations,
and have a maximum spatial uncertainty of 10
meters. From this initial list of tree genera observations, we get the five most frequently observed
species for each of the US states, including Alaska
and Hawaii, then combine into a single deduplicated list of common US tree genera. We select
these genera for further processing.


Of the remaining observations across common
tree genera, we drop any that have less than 500
samples per class, resulting in a final set of 39
genera (Table S15). We allocate 300 samples to
the train split and the rest to the test split (Table
S15). We treat observations as instantaneous



labels, using the date of the observation record
(eventdate) as a single-date valid period. Our final
US trees evaluation has a total of 11,700 training
points and 33,682 test points after pre-processing
and spatial proximity filtering.


_**S3.3.8. Descals oil palm**_


The Global oil palm extent and planting year from
1990 to 2021 reference dataset is an updated version of a dataset used to validate a previously
published global map of smallholder and industrial closed-canopy oil palm plantations (Descals
et al., 2021). The updated dataset was refined to
validate a 10-meter resolution global map of industrial and smallholder oil palm developed using
Sentinel-1 data for the years 2016–2021 (Descals,
2024). The 2024 version of the dataset covers regions where oil palm is found worldwide (Figure
S11) and makes several notable improvements
over the previous version, including updating labels where coconut plantations were incorrectly
labeled as oil palm and relabeling young plantations that were initially considered ‘other’ as oil
palm. Reference sites from the initial study were
selected using a simple random sample, making
the sampling design reusable for creating statistically rigorous accuracy metrics. We interpret
this dataset as reflecting land use as an oil-palm
plantation: points are labeled as being part of a
plantation if they were a closed canopy plantation some time in 2016-2021. We consider the

Descals oil palm reference dataset a useful evaluation of performance for subtle land use and
tropical commodity mapping.

(Validation_points_GlobalOP2016-2021.zip)
from the archived dataset (Descals, 2024). The
dataset has three classes, where class 0 represents
other land covers that are not closed-canopy oil
palm; class 1 represents closed-canopy industrial
oil palm; and class 2 represents closed-canopy
smallholder oil palm (Table S16). These classes
were initially determined based on observations
on imagery from 2019, but further informed
by observations over the years 2016-2021.
We assume that non-plantation to plantation
transitions are more likely than the reverse, so
while it’s possible that observations in some
years may not match the assigned label, it’s less
likely for later years. In order to make this into a
dataset that is useful as a training dataset, we
randomly assign one of the years in [2019, 2021]
to each row and set the valid period to that entire
year. Our final Descals oil palm evaluation has
a total of 600 training points and 16,877 test
points after pre-processing and spatial proximity
filtering.


_**S3.3.9. OpenET ensemble**_


The OpenET project aims to make satellite-based
estimates of the total amount of water that is

transferred from the land surface to the atmo
sphere through the process of evapotranspiration
(ET) available for improved water management
(Melton et al., 2022; Volk et al., 2024). OpenET
datasets include ET estimates from six different
satellite-driven ET models as well as an ensem
ble product, which is calculated as the mean of
the ensemble after filtering and removing outliers
using the median absolute deviation approach.
All models currently use 30-meter Landsat data
to produce ET estimates, and the monthly ET
dataset provides data on total ET by month as an
equivalent depth of water in millimeters.

Figure S13 | Distribution of OpenET ensemble
values. Values are reported in total mm evapotranspiration (ET) per month.



Figure S12 | Distribution of OpenET ensemble
sample locations.


Our OpenET evaluation dataset is derived from
the OpenET monthly total ensemble product in
Earth Engine. This dataset is designed not to
measure performance on ET estimation directly.
Rather, it characterizes performance on proxying
the OpenET model ensemble, given that ensemble
approaches are inherently computationally intensive and challenging to scale and has historically
limited OpenET ensemble coverage (i.e., Figure
S12). Thus accurate proxy models could be a
more viable means of scaling ensemble results
over larger extents.


We construct our OpenET evaluation by first
tiling CONUS in 35km grid cells in the Albers
conic projection with EPSG code 5070. For each
grid cell, we select a random month from all possible months mapped in the source OpenET ensemble product, and sample 2 locations for each
of 10 equally spaced 20mm bins between 0mm
and 200mm. Locations with ET values > 200mm

were assigned to the highest bin (Figure S13).
We ignore locations where less than 5 models in
the ensemble ran, or the disagreement between
the minimum and maximum model estimates ex


ceeded 10mm. To each sample we assigned a
valid period of the entire month from which it was
drawn, and a support period ending with the end
of the valid period, and extending 1 year prior:
this was chosen to emulate the realistic scenario

where evapotranspiration estimates are desired
at the conclusion of a given calendar month. We
selected 300 train points per bin, and allocated
the remainder to test. Our final OpenET ensemble evaluation has a total of 3,000 training points
and 32,683 test points after pre-processing and
spatial proximity filtering.


_**S3.3.10.**_ _**ASTER Global Emissivity Database**_
_**(GED)**_


Emissivity is an intrinsic property of materials
that describes how efficiently a surface can emit
radiation at a certain wavelength. The Advanced
Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is the most detailed emissivity
map of the Earth. The dataset was created by
processing millions of cloud free ASTER images
acquired between 2000 to 2008 (Hulley et al.,
2015). ASTER-GED land surface temperature
and emissivity are generated using a number of
physical process models that aim to separate temperature and emissivity from overall reflectance
signals. Like OpenET, we consider ASTER-GED
a proxy task that we can use to evaluate performance in terms of reproducing the results of a
more complex modelling workflow for estimating
a material property.


We sample the 100-meter ASTER-GED product available in Earth Engine (AG100: ASTER

AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



Figure S14 | Distribution of ASTER GED sample
locations.


Global Emissivity Dataset 100-meter V003;
"NASA/ASTER_GED/AG100_003") (Figure S14).
The original dataset was generated for the years
2000-2008. We assume surface properties are
relatively stable at 100-meter resolution (though
acknowledge this introduces added uncertainty
in signal). We select 2017 for both the support
and valid periods. We construct our sample by
first arbitrarily selecting the 8.3 _𝜇_ m band ("emissivity_band10") as our label, and subsetting to
locations for which all wavelength emissivity estimates had standard deviations < 0.05. We fur
ther subsetted to locations exclusively over land,
and within ± 60° latitude. We then oversampled
by selecting 330k of the remaining locations over
land, and culling them with spatial proximity filtering. We then sample 2000 locations from 10
equally spaced bins between emissivity values of
0.7 and 1.0. We selected 200 train points per
0.03 sized bin, and allocated the remainder to
test (Figure S15). Our final ASTER GED evaluation has a total of 2,000 training points and
15,636 test points after pre-processing.

### **S4. Details on evaluation setup**


For each of our 15 evaluation datasets, we iterate
through a suite of trials designed to test model
performance with varying degrees of label sparsity and various transfer methods.



Figure S15 | Distribution of ASTER GED values.
Note that emissivity of natural Earth surfaces is
a unitless quantity that typically ranges between
0.6 and 1.0. Surfaces with emissivities less than

0.85 are typically found over deserts and semiarid areas; vegetation, water, and ice have high
emissivities above 0.95.


**S4.1. Predictors**


Given a training set ( _𝑒_ _[𝑡]_ 1 _[, 𝑙]_ _[𝑡]_ 1 [)] _[, ...,]_ [ (] _[𝑒]_ _[𝑡]_ _𝑁_ _[, 𝑙]_ _[𝑡]_ _𝑁_ [)] [ of] _[ 𝑁]_ [exam-]
ples and a validation set _𝑙_ 1 _[𝑣]_ _[, ..., 𝑙]_ _[𝑣]_ _𝑀_ [of] _[ 𝑀]_ [embed-]
dings with held out labels, we fit a predictor, or
"transfer method", using the training set and then
report results on the validation set.


The purpose of the predictor is to obtain a label
_𝑙_ _𝑗_ for each embedding _𝑒_ _[𝑣]_ _𝑗_ [in the validation set. We]
consider two simple predictors: a linear predictor (or "linear probe") and kNN. We chose these
predictors as they are applicable to low-shot data
domains and require minimal parameterization
which avoids unduly penalizing any given method
due to non-optimal hyperparameters.


For linear classification, we follow the "RidgeClasifier" in scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011)
and use a one-vs-rest approach with a pure-linear
model per class. For each class in the training
set, we create labels {− 1 _,_ 1 } for each item in the
training set, where − 1 denotes absence of the
class and 1 presence. We then use ordinary least
squares to fit this model and obtain the predictor
with _𝜆_ = 0. As the classes are mutually exclusive,
a given example in the validation is then classified
based on which of the classifiers gave the highest
prediction.


For linear regression, we perform a simple leastsquares fit between predictor and target variables
with _𝜆_ = 0.


44


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



To run the kNN predictor, the nearest set of _𝑘_
embeddings _𝑒_ _[𝑡]_ _𝑛_ 1 _[, ..., 𝑒]_ _[𝑡]_ _𝑛𝑘_ [in the training set is found]
under an l2 distance. For a classification evaluation, with a set _𝐶_ of possible class labels, the
majority class labels of those _𝑘_ embeddings in the
train set is chosen:



rate of a random predictor. Any scores that managed to achieve a higher error rate than a random
predictor were clamped at 1.


**S4.3. Max trial group folds**


For datasets in our max-trial setting, we did not
always have an equivalent number of labels in
each training class. In these instances we drew
k-folds based on the least present class _𝑐_ [′] using
the formula:



_𝑙_ = max
_𝑗_
_𝑐_ ∈C



_𝑘_
∑︁ _𝑙_ _[𝑡]_ _𝑛𝑖_ [=] _[ 𝑐]_ (6)

_𝑖_



For kNN regression, a simple average is used
to obtain the final result:



(9)
�



E.g., Canada crops coarse for which _𝑐_ [′] = 75, we
drew _𝑘_ = 273 folds (Table S12). When all classes
had an equivalent number of training labels perclass, _𝑘_ = 1.


**S4.4. Uncertainty estimation**


We use two complementary approaches to compute the error bars for evaluation metrics. For
"low-shot" evaluation trials that do not use the

entire training split, we perform k-fold cross validation and randomly sample K class-balanced
training sets by subsampling the full training split,
fit an independent predictor to each set and compute a normal distribution over metrics.


_𝑚_ _𝑖_ =M({ _𝑓_ _𝑖_ ( _𝑒_ _𝑗_ ) _, 𝑙_ _𝑗_ } _[𝑀]_ _𝑗_ = [−] 0 [1] [)] (10)

For direct classification of change, we simply
concatenate each pair of embeddings characterizing Earth’s local state before/after an event in
both train and test, and follow through with the
aforementioned predictors as stated.


For unsupervised anomaly detection, we discard the train set and l2 normalize each pair of
validation embeddings providing a normalized
embedding before the event:, and after the event
. We now take the dot product between each pair,
remapped s.t. 0 = embeddings were the same, 1
= embeddings were on opposite poles:


1 − _𝑒_ [¯] _[𝑣]_
_𝑗_ [·][ ¯] _[𝑝]_ _[𝑣]_ _𝑗_
_𝑑_ _𝑗_ = (8)
2


We now choose a global threshold _𝑠_ on ( 0 _,_ 1 )
to binarize all _𝑑_ _𝑗_, and thus provide a predicted
_𝑙_ _𝑗_ to compare to _𝑙_ _𝑗_ _𝑣_ . _𝑠_ is chosen from one of

[ 0 _._ 1 _,_ 0 _._ 2 _,_ 0 _._ 3 _,_ 0 _._ 4 _,_ 0 _._ 5 _,_ 0 _._ 6 _,_ 0 _._ 7 _,_ 0 _._ 8 _,_ 0 _._ 9 ] to maximize BA over the entire validation dataset, and
then all other metrics are computed using this
threshold.


**S4.2. Kappa adjustment**


When stated, kappa adjusted metrics were
rescaled by linearly transforming the metric range
by the metric value a "random" predictor would
achieve on average. For Balanced Error Rate
(BER), 1 was remapped to the balanced error



where _𝑚_ _𝑖_ is the value of the metric M computed on the validation set for the predictor _𝑓_ _𝑖_
fitted to the _𝑖_ th training fold.

For "full" evaluation trials, where we use the
entire training split to fit the downstream predictor, we instead use bootstrap statistics instead,
resampling the validation split with replacement
_𝐵_ = 100 times and computing statistics across the
samples:


_𝑚_ _𝑖_ =M({ _𝑓_ ( _𝑒_ _𝑗_ ) _, 𝑙_ _𝑗_ _, 𝑤_ [(] _𝑗_ _[𝑖]_ [)] [}] _[𝑀]_ _𝑗_ = [−] 0 [1] [)] (13)



comparable manner. In the following sections, we
describe the process by which we obtain embeddings (or embedding-like feature vectors), and
how those embeddings/features are extracted
and aggregated. This process has to be redone
for each temporal window or spatial extent under study by obtaining the correct EO data and
running their model and/or assessing resulting
feature vectors using our standardized evaluation
framework and datasets.


To extract features/embeddings from baselines
with outputs at a coarser spatial resolution than
AEF, we bi-linearly resample spatial dimensions
to 10m, and extract the embedding at the precise
location of the evaluation dataset sample. This
location was centered as much as possible in the
geographic tile used for inference, and as the
(longitude, latitude) coordinates of labels were
kept at full precision, sub-pixel aliasing was taken
into account for extraction.


As we were interested in assessing the extrapolation power given only sparse in-situ observations, for linear probes we did not attempt to fit
a full-patch linear decoder to the ViT-based approaches that produced spatially coarse tokens
(ViT, Prithvi, Clay). We instead fit a per-pixel linear model after bi-linearly resampling the tokens
to 10m. To ensure equivalence to full-patch decoding, all evaluations concerned the same pixel
location (center) such that we were consistently
fitting one of the many linear combinations we
would have fit had we used a full-patch decoder.


**S5.1. Controls (not EO-specific)**


_**S5.1.1. XY**_


The XY coordinate baseline assumes that the

geospatial coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude) of a given set of sparsely distributed
geocoded labels or observations can be used to
simply interpolate values spatially. This control
essentially tests the hypothesis that location "Is
All You Need”. We decompose polar latitude and
longitude coordinates in degrees into sine and
cosine components. This puts coordinate values
in a continuous range of values, removing the
discontinuity that would otherwise result at the
antimeridian. We concatenate the results, and

where is a weight indicating how many times
the _𝑗_ th validation example is included in the _𝑖_ th
bootstrap sample (satisfying [�] _[𝑀]_ _𝑗_ = [−] 0 [1] _[𝑤]_ [(] _𝑗_ _[𝑖]_ [)] = _𝑀_ ).


For smaller datasets where it was not possible
to create a balanced training set with at least 200
examples in each class (or 200 examples overall
for regression tasks), we used a combination of
multiple training sets (with number of examples
per class equal to the size of the smallest class)
and nested bootstrap resampling of the validation
split to estimate the statistics.

### **S5. Baseline comparisons**


We considered both widely adopted feature engineering approaches developed by the EO research community, as well as new deep learning
approaches adapted for use with geospatial image inputs. We also included a set of controls
to establish the predictive power of purely geographic information as well as a generic vision
model trained on camera imagery (see Table S17
for summary).


Due to differences in handling of spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions and hard-coded
data source requirements, it is not always straightforward to apply them to our benchmark or in a

treat the resulting vectors as four-dimensional
positional XY embeddings.


We note that XY is not time-varying, so we
were unable to assess change detection evaluations and we generally expect poor performance
on evaluations where landscapes are dynamic
(e.g. agriculture).


_**S5.1.2. XYZ**_


The XYZ control extends the XY baseline to a

three-dimensional location coordinate by including elevation (height) information. Elevation
plays a role in both regulating abiotic conditions
and may act as a proxy for other terrain-driven
process interactions, e.g., (Hof et al., 2012).
Therefore, the XYZ control tests the hypothesis
that adding height information to positional encodings will improve predictive power. As with
the XY baseline, we decompose latitude and longitude into trigonometric components. We also
retrieve elevation information from the Copernicus GLO-30 DEM (see supplemental materials
S1.8 for more details on this dataset). We mosaic
individual images in the GLO-30 collection and
select the elevation band (‘DEM’). Images are reprojected to WGS84 with a 1 arcsecond resolution
for sampling. Elevation values are normalized



based on the mean and standard deviation of the

training sample elevations. We concatenate XY
coordinates with sampled elevation, resulting in
five-dimensional positional XYZ embeddings.


We note that XYZ is not time-varying, so we
were unable to assess change detection evaluations and we generally expect poor performance
on evaluations where landscapes are dynamic
(e.g. agriculture).


_**S5.1.3. Vision Transformer (ViT)**_


The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a popular deep
learning architecture for computer vision. We use
a ViT trained on the standard ImageNet benchmark of images and classification annotations
(Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) as a control. This is
nominally a general-purpose model for computer
vision, so we include it as a control to assess
performance in comparison to systems designed
specifically for EO data.


We choose the ViT-L/16 model architecture and
parameters because it is popular for benchmarking and transfer learning in machine learning and
computer vision papers, e.g. (Chen et al., 2021).
As a pre-trained vision model for ImageNet, the
ViT is limited in its resolution, bands, and han

AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



dling of multi-temporal imagery. Standard ViTs
only accept a single RGB color image, so we select
the RGB bands of Sentinel-2 (L1C) normalized
to the training statistics as input. These are the
bands B2 (blue), B3 (green), and B4 (red). Each
input image is embedded independently across
time, and the outputs are masked using the input
mask. Time is then collapsed by output averaging (weighted by masks). The result is a 1024dimensional multi-temporal ViT embedding.


To maximize the performance of the ViT control, we tuned its hyperparameters to the evaluation set. We tried additional versions including
one using annual composites, random initialization, and stacking all features through time. We
found the version described here the most performant, and surprisingly more performant than
non-controls in a number of instances.


**S5.2. Designed EO features**


_**S5.2.1. Composites**_


Rather than rely on reflectance values from any individual image acquisition, composite approaches
combine observations from multiple image acquisitions to generate spatially continuous mosaics
that optimize for pixel "quality", acquisition timing, and increasing signal-to-noise. Compositing
approaches are fairly ubiquitous in modern remote sensing applications, i.e., (Francini et al.,
2023; Qiu et al., 2023). Median composites are
fairly standard for optical imagery and tend to
be preferred over mean composites because (a)
medians preserve observed data values, and (b)
are less sensitive to outliers, particularly clouds
and cloud shadows which spectrally lie at very
extreme bright and dark values. For radar imagery, mean composites tend to be more common
as the goal is less-so to avoid outliers and select
real data values, and more-so to smooth across
many noisy observations varying with slight deviations in acquisition geometry. Composites are
inherently lower-dimensional and orderless (compared with a stack of images which would be
higher-dimensional and preserve the time order
of observations), but serve as an important baseline for pure spectral information from minimally
transformed de-noised/cloud-free image inputs.



We composite inputs across time by taking the
median for optical sources (Sentinel-2, Landsat8/9) and the mean for radar sources (Sentinel1). Composite inputs are pre-processed using the
same methods described in supplemental materials S1 and standardized by the AEF pretraining
dataset statistics. Individual images are padded
and masked as necessary to get constant input
data dimensions. We filter by taking the observations in the valid period when we have them, and
by taking the closest observations to the valid period bounds when we do not. Image sources are
combined by concatenation, so the dimension of
the composite feature space varies with the choice
and number of sources. The number of channels

is equal to the sum of the number of bands across
sources, i.e., compositing in this way takes the
input shape _𝐵𝑥𝑇𝑥𝐻𝑥𝑊𝑥𝐷_ and makes the output
shape _𝐵𝑥𝐻𝑥𝑊𝑥𝐷_ [′] . The final composite feature
vector or “embedding” has 16 dimensions across
the same Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8/9
bands used for AEF inference.


To maximize the performance of the composite baseline, we tuned its hyperparameters to
the evaluation set. We tried additional versions

including one using a consistently annual date
range, mean rather than median compositing,
versions that omitted all combinations of optical /
radar sources, and versions that omitted masking.
We found the version described here the most

performant.


_**S5.2.2.**_ _**Continuous Change Detection and Clas-**_
_**sification (CCDC)**_


Harmonic curve-fitting has become an increasingly common approach for generating features
that characterize spectral-temporal trajectories,
e.g., (Pasquarella et al., 2018; Wilson et al.,
2018). The most basic way to generate these sorts
of harmonics would be simply fitting linear models to time series of EO data, e.g., (Wilson et al.,
2018). However, there are several more sophisticated temporal segmentation approaches that
generate such features as part of a larger change
detection workflows, i.e., Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) (Verbesselt et al., 2010),
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Change
Detection (EWMACD) (Brooks et al., 2014), and


48


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014) approach. We chose to use the CCDC approach
because it is (a) well-known and widely used for
remote sensing applications (see Pasquarella et al.
(2022) for a review) and (b) has already been run
globally and surfaced as a dataset, making it one
of the few existing examples of a model-as-dataset
currently available globally in a cloud-computing
environment.


We use precomputed CCDC features/parameters from the global Landsat-based Earth Engine
collection available for 1999-2024 (“projects/CCDC/measures/v4”), which is an updated version
of the Google Global Landsat-based CCDC Segments (1999-2019) dataset described in Gorelick
et al. (2023). CCDC coefficients are stored as
variable-length arrays and are accessible as an
Earth Engine Image Collection. We select the
eight harmonic coefficients in the *_coefs bands

[ _𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡_, _𝑡_, _𝑐𝑜𝑠_ ( _𝜔_ _𝑡_ ), _𝑠𝑖𝑛_ ( _𝜔𝑡_ ), _𝑐𝑜𝑠_ ( 2 _𝜔𝑡_ ), _𝑠𝑖𝑛_ ( 2 _𝜔𝑡_ ),
_𝑐𝑜𝑠_ ( 3 _𝜔𝑡_ ), _𝑠𝑖𝑛_ ( 3 _𝜔𝑡_ )] plus the *_rmse values for
seven Landsat bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR,
SWIR1, SWIR2, thermal). To match CCDC coefficients with a valid period, we choose the segment
that intersects the valid period date for singledate evaluations and the middle of the specified
valid period for monthly and annual evaluations.
The final CCDC feature vector or “embedding”
has 56 dimensions (8 coefficients for 7 Landsat
bands).


_**S5.2.3. MOSAIKS**_


Multi-task Observation using Satellite Imagery &
Kitchen Sinks (MOSAIKS) is a designed nonlinear
representation of satellite imagery intended as
analysis-ready data for accessible use and efficient
computation across downstream tasks (70). It
can be seen as a randomly-initialized linear combination of source data in a small sliding window
with an additional non-linearity. The MOSAIKS
approach provides a spatially localized representation of input satellite imagery at a specific time,
bearing the same lack-of temporal constraints as
composites. In particular it was first designed for
RGB composite inputs and then generalized to
RGB Sentinel-2 inputs. The MOSAIKS output is
high dimensional and configurable (with a de


fault of 8192 in the original implementation and
1024 in our reference implementation).


The original model described in (Rolf et al.,
2021) was developed for only single-date RGB imagery. We reference the Microsoft Planetary Computer implementation (Microsoft, 2021), which
generates random filters rather than selecting
input patches. Specifically, we sample random
convolutional filter parameters, once, for all inputs, convolve each input image with these random filters, stack the filter responses and their
negatives to double the channels, apply a ReLU
nonlinearity so the representation is not simply
linear, and pool out the spatial dimensions for a
vector embedding of each input.


We also extend our implementation to support multi-source output averaging where embeddings are generated for each source then averaged across the sources. This approach is preferred over concatenating embeddings for multiple sources as the specified embedding dimensionality is preserved regardless of the number
of sources. Similarly, we accommodate multitemporal embeddings by averaging outputs across
time. The resulting multi-source, multi-temporal
MOSAIKS embeddings have 1024 dimensions.


To maximize the performance of the MOSAIKS
baseline, we tuned its hyperparameters to the
evaluation set. We tried additional versions in
cluding one using a consistently annual input
date range, versions that utilize composited inputs like those described in supplemental materials S5.2.1, versions that omitted all combinations of optical / radar sources, versions with

[ 64 _,_ 128 _,_ 256 _,_ 1024 _,_ 8192 ] output features, and
versions stacking all features through time. We
found the version described here the most perfor
mant.


**S5.3. Learned EO features**


_**S5.3.1. SatCLIP**_


SatCLIP is a deep learning-based approach that
takes inspiration from CLIP approach (Radford
et al., 2021), training location and image encoders via contrastive learning and matching images to their corresponding locations (Klemmer


49


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



et al., 2025). SatCLIP models are trained on the
pre-extracted Sentinel-2-100k dataset, a collection of 100 000 Sentinel-2 images that includes all
available bands (B01, B02, B03, B04, B06, B06,
B07, B08, B08A, B09, B11, B12) resampled to
10m resolution. The SatCLIP authors provide six
pretrained SatCLIP models, trained with different
vision encoders and spatial resolution hyperpa
rameters.


We evaluate only the SatCLIP Vit16-L40 model,
which outperforms other versions according to
the SatCLIP paper (Klemmer et al., 2025). During evaluation, we use only the location encoder,
following the procedure suggested by the authors. No specific preprocessing of the locations
is required beforehand, i.e., the location encoder
takes longitude and latitude. Generated SatCLIP
embeddings have 256 dimensions. We note that
SatCLIP is not time-varying, so we were unable to
assess change detection evaluations and we generally expect poor performance on evaluations
where landscapes are dynamic (e.g. agriculture).


_**S5.3.2. Prithvi**_


Prithvi is a temporal pre-trained ViT-based architecture trained in a fashion similar to Cong et al.
(2022) on Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS)
L30 imagery with 30m nominal scale collected
over the contiguous United States during 2017
(Jakubik et al., 2023a,b). Input videos are limited to three in the model version provided by the
authors. Prithvi is considered a geospatial foundation model, the encoder output from which
can be used to solve various downstream tasks.

While Prithvi authors only explicitly suggest its
use with additional deep-learning decoders, it
is common to transfer ViT-like architectures via

linear decoding as we do here.


We use the Prithvi 1.0 model and adapt the approach described in the Prithvi-specific example
HLS Multi-temporal Crop Classification Model
(Li et al., 2023), where encoder outputs are used
as embeddings in a crop classification task. The
multi-temporal embedding dimension is equal to
768 multiplied by the number of frames available
(1 to 3) yielding 768 to 2304 dimensions.


We retrieve input data from the HLSL30: HLS


2 Landsat Operational Land Imager Surface Reflectance and TOA Brightness Daily Global 30m
collection (Masek et al., 2021) on Earth Engine ("NASA/HLS/HLSL30/v002"). We sample
patches of 224x224 at a 30-meter spatial resolution. We fetch all images under a specified
cloud cover threshold (20% or 50%) for the support period and incrementally increase the frame
(into the past) by the HLS maximum revisit period until we find an available image. We use a
cloud coverage threshold of 20% for all evaluation
datasets with the exception of the Descals evaluation dataset, where we use a higher (50%) cloud
coverage threshold due to low imagery availability. In rare instances (< 1% for any given dataset),
the cloud coverage-based filtering yields no data,
and in these cases we set embeddings for such
entries as the expectation over the computed embeddings for a given dataset.


_**S5.3.3. Clay**_


The Clay Foundation Model is more akin to a
traditional ViT differentiated by the use of input metadata at inference time. This metadata
includes nominal resolution, the geographic centroid of the input, a source encoding derived from
a wavelength associated with the bandpass or
transmission when applicable, and the observation timestamp (Clay, 2024). Generating semantic embeddings for any location and time is a
stated use case for the Clay model, and classification, regression, and detecting changes over time
are suggested use-cases by the authors.


We sample 256x256 pixel images with a nominal scale of 10 meters for Sentinel-2 / Sentinel1, and 30 meters for Landsat 8/9 per authorprovided instructions. We filter out Landsat and
Sentinel-2 images with cloud coverage exceeding
20%, after that we limit the number of entries per
time frame to fit them into NVIDIA V100 RAM
(30 frames maximum). Input images are normalized using statistics unique to each evaluation’s
training split. To obtain the final embedding over
the valid period, we average over per-source pertime spatial tokens for a final dimensionality of
768. When no imagery for a particular source is
available within the valid period, we follow the
procedure used for HLS detailed in supplemental


50

materials S5.3.2.


There are a number of suggested mechanisms
for extracting embeddings from The Clay Foundation Model. For example, the authors suggest
taking the class token as a patch embedding, and
in others, the non-class tokens are averaged. To
tune Clay hyperparameters to our evaluation set,
we tried a number of Clay variants. These included using the class token for a patch representation and versions that omitted combinations

of optical / radar sources. We found the version
described here the most performant.

### **S6. Additional results & discussion**


**S6.1.** **Comparisons with 10 and 1 samples per-**
**class**


In our extreme low-shot trials, overall performance of methods was close to random chance

in many cases. For 500-fold 10-shot trials, AEF
error reductions were only > 1.0x in the ~90%
confidence interval for 8/15 evaluations with an
average range of variation ± 0 _._ 38 x, and for 1000fold 1-shot trials, AEF error reductions were only
_>_ 1 _._ 0 x in the ~90% confidence interval in 5/15
evaluations with average variation ± 0 _._ 49 x . While
the mean gain was in AEF’s favor for both settings,
we consider the extreme degree of variability indicative that adequate general 1-shot or 10-shot
performance remains an unsolved research frontier.


**S6.2. Classification**


AEF showed consistently strong performance
across all classification evaluations, while the
next-best approach varies considerably with some
approaches performing no better than the null
expectation for some datasets (Figure S16). This
result indicates the utility of AEF as a generalpurpose feature space suitable for a multitude of
classification problems ranging from simple, binary legends to detailed land use, land cover, and
even genus-level tree species mapping. While further iteration on training labels and/or secondary
predictors may improve absolute accuracies, AEF
shows previously unachievable performance in
low-shot regimes with simple classifiers, unlock


ing use cases that may have previously been untenable given sparse observational records and/or
highly detailed taxonomies.


For the applications considered, AEF often offers a notable improvement over other archetypal
examples of other designed and learned feature
spaces. CCDC harmonics were the next-best predictors for Canada crops (coarse and fine) and
Africa crop mask, suggesting spectral-temporal
information characterizing phenology is more important than spatial resolution or multi-sensor
inputs for these crop-mapping applications. SatCLIP was the next-best approach for Ethiopia
crops and US trees, evaluations we would expect
should benefit phenological information. Preference for SatCLIP here suggests encoding localized
EO features was beneficial for these tasks, and
improvements for SatCLIP relative to the coordinate and ViT controls indicate that these gains
can be attributed to inclusion of EO-specific information content. We find that MOSAIKS is the
next-best predictor for GLancE and LCMAP land
cover, while Clay for LUCAS land use and land
cover. Preference for MOSAIKS indicates spatial
context provides valuable information for land
cover mapping at both national and global scales,
as it would for Clay which also does not have
access to multitemporal information.


Interestingly, we found that in some cases, controls were selected as the second-best approach,
specifically the XYZ control for the Descals oil
palm evaluation and the ViT for the LCMAP land
use evaluation. This suggests that AEF is more
effectively leveraging EO-specific data sources to
generate learned representations than other baselines that do not consistently outperform controls.
In general, we found Prithvi to exhibit poor performance. This is not particularly surprising given
the model is not explicitly designed to provide
a feature space, and confirms that Prithvi is not
well-suited for this sort of low-shot classification
and requires additional fine-tuning. However, it is
interesting to note the lack of parity with the ViT
control that has not been trained on EO data, does
not have access to multitemporal information, nor
is intended to function as a feature space.


Of the low-shot classification methods considered, AEF features typically exhibited the great

est balanced accuracies for the linear classifier
experiments for the max trial groups, with the
exception of Ethiopia crops, where kNN with
k=1 is preferred (Figure S16). We believe the
Ethiopia crops evaluation is particularly challenging given its extreme sparsity and fine scale, and
so simple nearest neighbor classification was the
best method of transfer for a handful of methods.

Given the generally poor performance of all methods on this four class classification problem, there
are opportunities to improve performance on this
type of dataset.


**S6.3. Regression**


For regression tasks, AEF again exhibited the best
overall performance in terms of both gains in _𝑅_ [2]

and reductions in MAE (Figures S17 and S18).
We find that _𝑅_ [2] values for AEF are always within a
valid range, noting that several other approaches
produced negative _𝑅_ [2] values i.e. worse-than-null
performance for ASTER GED (emissivity prediction). OpenET ensemble (evapotranspiration prediction) was evidently more challenging where
almost all other methods had negative values
(clipped to − 0 _._ 01 for plotting purposes; Figure

S17).



Figure S18 | Regression results reported in terms
of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Error bars indicate 1 _𝜎_ (68.27%) confidence interval by bootstrapping. Dotted line represents approximate
expectation of error from product publications.


For predicting ASTER emissivity values, MOSAIKS is the next-best approach and composites generally show strong performance, while
spectral-temporal CCDC features and XY and
XYZ positional encodings are demonstrably worse.
This indicates that local spatial patterns and overall reflectance (as opposed to seasonality in reflectance) are important factors for this use case.


When evaluating on the OpenET Ensemble
dataset, we found that AEF was the only approach
to produce viable results using all kNN and linear predictors considered. Of the other baselines,
composites with linear probes and MOSAIKS with
knn with k=3 produced the only other viable results in terms of having _𝑅_ [2] values greater than 0
(i.e., greater variance explained than the mean).
Looking at results in terms of MAE where lower
values indicate better performance, we find AEF
has an error rate in line with what would be ex
pected for both ASTER GED and OpenET performance expectations for the data products these
evaluation datasets were sampled from (Figure
S18). Here we can more clearly see variability
in performance, with particularly large errors for
SatCLIP and Prithvi linear trials.


Though we note the small sample use cases
represented here, we do note that continuous

baselines as additional observations are added
(Figure S21). Baselines were omitted when _𝑅_ [2]

values were < 0, or for change detection evaluations when the baseline was not time-varying
(SatCLIP). We note no obvious trend among the
baselines, indicating methodologies that perform
better on some problems more so than others.
AEF generally improves monotonically as additional observations are added for 9-of-15 evaluation datasets. There is some unpredictable nonmonotonicity for some evals, but we do not identify any obvious grouping or regional bias.


**S7.2. Sources**

in terms of balanced accuracy. The black dottedline indicates random chance for classification
evaluations given the number of classes. Error
bars indicate 1 _𝜎_ (68.27%)confidence interval by
bootstrapping.


measurements, as opposed to discrete categorical
labels, are often associated with field-based observational datasets, and we expect to see external
comparisons including AEF on additional regression problems in the future following our data
release (see Global embeddings dataset section).


**S6.4. Change detection**


The SatCLIP, XY, and XYZ baselines were omitted
from change detection comparisons given these
approaches are location-only, i.e., have no time
handling or way to differentiate between observations at different times. We find generally less
differentiation in performance across methods,
with the exception of Prithvi and linear trials of
MOSAIKS, which perform at or near the random
baseline (Figure S19).

### **S7. Ablations**


**S7.1. Training observations**


We share a full set of plots detailing the performance scaling of AEF relative to other learned



We share a full set of plots detailing the performance of AEF relative to ablated by source groups.
The groups are as follows: Optical (Sentinel-2,
Landsat-8 / Landsat-9), Radar (Sentinel-1, PALSAR2 ScanSAR), LiDAR (GEDI), Environmental
(GLO 30, ERA5 Land, GRACE), and Annotated
(NLCD, Wikipedia) (Figure S21). We note a variety of patterns characterized by source groups,
though 11-of-15 evaluations were most performant with all groups. Evidently, different evaluations "prefer" different types of measurements;
in some cases this is expected e.g. the Descals
oil palm evaluation is most performant with Optical + Radar + LiDAR as these groups offer the
most information regarding sub-canopy structure,
where climatic variables and free-form text an
notations / land-cover labels are less informative. Unsurprisingly, all LULC evaluations (excluding change) are most performant with all
groups including the Annotated group, though
interestingly this does not lead to the biggest performance gain compared to adding radar and
lidar data.


**S7.3. Bottleneck characteristics**


AEF’s reconstruction task relies on a noisy bottleneck to compress and extrapolate information
from the sparse input sequence. Two model hyperparameters, the embedding dimension, and
the channel noise parameterized by VMF _𝜅_, directly affect the capacity of this bottleneck. Lower
settings of _𝜅_ in particular will also affect the
smoothness of the latent (embedding) manifold

60


AlphaEarth Foundations: An embedding field model for accurate and efficient global mapping from sparse label data



due to the regularizing effect of the noise (Kingma
et al., 2013). This last property is desirable when
using embeddings for nearest neighbor retrieval
as distances measured along a smooth (lower dimensional) manifold are more meaningful than
those in a higher dimensional space (assuming
the manifold hypothesis (Fefferman et al., 2016).
Therefore contention exists between a smoother

embedding space (lower _𝜅_ ), and the information
capacity of the channel and therefore embedding
(higher _𝜅_ ). We explore this in the context of embedding dimension across all methods of transfer
and trial group sizes in Figure S22. The setting
used for AEF was Embedding _𝐷_ = 64, _𝜅_ = 8e3.


We find that performance as a function of
bottleneck characteristics varies considerably depending on the evaluation dataset. One expected
trend emerges for datasets with larger legends
compared to e.g. two or three class classification problems in the max-trial setting: Canada
crops (fine), LUCAS derived datasets, and iNaturalist trees all tend to perform better with more
concentrated noise and higher embedding dimensions. We also, expectedly, find that a noisier
bottleneck seems to improve, or not impact, the
performance in the smaller trial groups (500x10,
1000x1). This is most evident in Canada crops
derived datasets and OpenET ensemble.

### **S8. Inference**


**S8.1. Quantization**


To reduce the storage and compute requirements for working with our released embedding
field data, we opted to test a number of postquantization schemes. We tried quantizing 32-bit
float values to signed 8-bit and 16-bit integers
using a method identical to the following pseudoJAX method:



**Integer type** **Scale** **Min** **Max**
**value** **value**


int8 (s8) 127.5 127 127


int16 (s16) 32767.5 32767 32767


Table S18 | Quantization parameters.


(a) Quantization results for regression evals.


Values were dequantized using a method identical to the following pseudo-JAX method:


The exponentiation was introduced to preserve
information in the least significant digits of dequantized values. We used the following scale,
minimum, and maximum values according to Table S18.


We did not initially assume that 8-bits ought to
be enough for any evaluation given that quantization was not part of the learning process, we were
nonetheless pleased to note little performance
variability compared to the non-quantized embeddings as shown in Figure S23A-C. As quantization was not part of our comparisons, we chose
to quantize to 8-bits with power = 2 as this gave
the best storage / performance tradeoff based on
evaluation performance. We believe our comparison results with this quantization strategy would
be largely the same as without.

(b) Quantization results for change detection evals.


**S8.2. Creating embedding fields**


To produce global, annual, embedding field layers, we divide the world into UTM zones, and
run inference in a tiling of each zone by 960m x
960m. Before input sources are collected, each
tile is individually buffered by 160m on each side
(overtiling) to provide a 1.28km x 1.28km tile for
inference. Sources are collected using the same
protocol as for our training data, a model forward
pass is run, and the outer 80m is trimmed from
each tile before rendering back onto the UTM
zone. We include the tiles that slightly extend
beyond UTM zone degree boundaries to avoid
seams when using the data in different projections.


Our inference system is the same as our training data collection system, and is backed entirely
by Earth Engine. A great degree of care was
taken to ensure our inference system respects
the shared capacity of Earth Engine while scaling to hundreds of billions of observations. As
we’ve demonstrated strong performance in our
annual-period evaluations, we hope our annual
embedding fields enable more practitioners to
achieve similar results without the need or ex
pense of pushing field campaigns to meet the
needs of custom deep learning workflows.


**S8.3. Production model (AEF v2.1)**


The results presented in this study reflect the
performance of v2.0 of the AEF model. Based
on feedback we received on annual embedding
fields generated with the v2.0 model, we made a
number of fixes and improvements. Specifically:



1. We removed requirements that specific targets or input sensors be present in our training sample and re-generated our training
dataset. This lead to the addition of a large
number of samples from Antarctica that
had previously been dropped due to limited
coverage, and increased the count of our
training video sequences from 8,412,511 to
10,182,450 sequences.
2. Independent tests revealed a performance regression for crop classification in the conterminous United States. We determined that

this was related to the inclusion of NLCD in

the training mixture. We addressed this by
adding additional data from the USDA Cropland Data Layers (CDL) (USDA NASS, 2024)
through 2023 (omitting the data from 2024)
as a target, and the loss weight for NLCD and
CDL was lowered from 0 _._ 50 to 0 _._ 25.

3. We identified and fixed a bug in our processing software that where incorrect handling of
time codes for Sentinel-2 images acquired on
January 1 resulted in divergent embedding
values and visible swath artifacts in affected

years.
4. We identified and fixed a bug in our processing software where frame sub-sampling, like
that during training, was applied at inference
time. Embeddings generated with AEF v2.1
now use a full year of imagery for inference.
5. We took further steps to mitigate tiling artifacts by applying frame-dropout to the
teacher model mirroring that applied to the
student.

6. We also achieved a reduction in subtle ar
tifacts from multi-resolution pixel targets
by modifying re-gridding to include random
shifts within the grid size prior to downsampling.
